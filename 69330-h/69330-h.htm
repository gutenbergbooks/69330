<p class="in0"><span class="smcap">The</span> present Memoir of Sir Walter Scott was written
by my brother, the late Dr R. Chambers, immediately
after the decease of the great novelist, and having been
issued at a small price for popular reading, had what was
then considered a large circulation—180,000 copies. It
was subsequently republished, with some improvements.
The Memoir is now reproduced in somewhat better
style, as a small but fitting contribution in homage
of the great man, the centenary of whose birth, 15th
August 1871, is about to be very generally celebrated.
I have taken the liberty of adding only a few paragraphs,
distinguishable by being enclosed within brackets. The
principal of these insertions refers to the manner in
which my brother had the honour to become acquainted
with, and acquired the esteem of, Sir Walter Scott.</p>

<p>To the Memoir are now appropriately appended
certain ‘Abbotsford Notanda,’ descriptive of the friendly
intercourse which long subsisted between Sir Walter
and his factor and amanuensis, William Laidlaw, prepared
by one well qualified to write on the subject,
Dr R. Carruthers, Inverness.</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap b"><span class="smcap1">Sir Walter Scott</span> was one of the sons of
Walter Scott, Esq., Writer to the Signet, by Anne,
daughter of Dr John Rutherford, Professor of the
Practice of Medicine in the University of Edinburgh.</p>

<p>His paternal grandfather, Mr Robert Scott, farmer at
Sandyknow, in the vicinity of Smailholm Tower, in
Roxburghshire, was the son of Mr Walter Scott, a
younger son of Walter Scott of Raeburn, who in his
turn was third son of Sir William Scott of Harden, in
which family the chieftainship of the race of Scott is
now understood to reside. Sir Walter’s grandfather, Mr
Robert Scott, farmer at Sandyknow, as we learn from
the <i>Border Antiquities</i>, ‘though both descended from
and allied to several respectable Border families, was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">2</span>
chiefly distinguished for the excellent good sense and
independent spirit which enabled him to lead the way
in agricultural improvement—then a pursuit abandoned
to persons of a very inferior description. His memory
was long preserved in Teviotdale, and still survives, as
that of an active and intelligent farmer, and the father
of a family all of whom were distinguished by talents,
probity, and remarkable success in the pursuits which
they adopted.’</p>

<p>Walter, the third son of Sir William Scott of Harden,
lived at the time of the Restoration, and embraced the
tenets of Quakerism, which at that period made their
way into Scotland. For this he endured a degree of
persecution for which it is now difficult to assign a
reason. The Scottish Privy-council, by an edict dated
June 20, 1665, directed his brother, the existing representative
of the Harden family, to take away his
three children, and educate them separately, so that
they might not become infected with the same heresy;
and, for doing so, he was to be entitled to sue his
brother for the maintenance of the children. By a
second edict, dated July 5, 1666, the Council directed
two thousand pounds Scots money to be paid by the
Laird of Raeburn for this purpose; and, as he was now
confined in the Tolbooth of Edinburgh, where he was
liable to be further tainted by converse with others of
the same sect there also imprisoned, the Council further
ordered him to be transported to the jail of Jedburgh,
where no one was to have access to him but such as
might be expected, to convert him from his present
principles.</p>

<p>Walter, the second son of this gentleman, and father
to the novelist’s grandfather, received a good education<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">3</span>
at Glasgow College, under the protection of his uncle.
He was a zealous Jacobite—a friend and correspondent
of Dr Pitcairn—and made a vow never to shave his
beard till the exiled House of Stuart should be restored;
whence he acquired the name of <em>Beardie</em>.</p>

<p>Dr John Rutherford, maternal grandfather to the
subject of this memoir, was one of four Scottish pupils
of Boerhaave, who, in the early part of the last century,
contributed to establish the high character of the Edinburgh
University as a school of medicine. He was
the first Professor of the Practice of Physic in the
university, to which office he was elected in 1727, and
which he resigned in 1766, in favour of the celebrated
Dr John Gregory. He was also the first person who
delivered lectures on Clinical Medicine in the Infirmary.
His son, Dr Daniel Rutherford, maternal uncle to the
novelist, was afterwards, for a long period, Professor of
Botany in the Edinburgh University, and further distinguished
by his great proficiency in chemistry. Dr
D. Rutherford was one of the cleverest scientific men
of his day; and, but for certain unimportant circumstances,
would have been preferred to the high honour
of succeeding Black in the chair of Chemistry. When
he took his degree in 1772, Pneumatic Chemistry was in
its infancy. Upon this occasion he published a thesis,
in which the doctrines respecting gaseous bodies are
laid down with great perspicuity, as far as they were
then known, and an account also given of a series
of experiments made by himself, which discover much
ingenuity and address. He was the first European
chemist who, if the expression may be used, <em>discovered</em>
nitrogen. Had he proceeded a single step farther, he
would have anticipated the discoveries of Priestley,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">4</span>
Scheele, and Lavoisier, respecting oxygen, which have
rendered their names immortal. As it was, the experiments
and discoveries of Dr Rutherford made his name
respected all over Europe.</p>

<p>The wife of Dr John Rutherford, and maternal grandmother
of Sir Walter Scott, was Jean Swinton, daughter
of Swinton of Swinton, in Berwickshire, one of the
oldest families in Scotland, and at one period very
powerful. Sir Walter has introduced a chivalric representative
of this race into his drama of <i>Halidon Hill</i>.
The grandfather of Jean Swinton was Sir John Swinton,
the twentieth baron in lineal descent, and the son of
the celebrated Judge Swinton, to whom, along with Sir
William Lockhart of Lee, Cromwell intrusted the chief
management of civil affairs in Scotland during his
usurpation. Lord Swinton, as he was called, in virtue
of his judicial character, was seized, after the Restoration,
and brought down to Scotland for trial, in the
same vessel with the Marquis of Argyll. It was
generally expected that one who had played so conspicuous
a part in the late usurpation, would not elude
the vengeance of the new government. He escaped,
however, by suddenly adopting the tenets of the society
to which Walter Scott of Raeburn afterwards attached
himself. On being brought before the parliament for
trial, he rejected all means of legal defence; and his
simply penitent appearance and venerable aspect
wrought so far with his judges, that he was acquitted,
while less obnoxious men were condemned. It was
from this extraordinary person, and while confined
along with him in Edinburgh Castle, that Colonel David
Barclay, father of Robert Barclay, the eminent author of
the <i>Apology for the Quakers</i>, contracted those sentiments<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">5</span>
which afterwards shone forth with such remarkable
lustre in his son.</p>

<p>While the ancestry of Sir Walter Scott is thus
shewn to have been somewhat more than respectable,
it must be also stated, that, in his character as a man,
a citizen, or a professional agent, there could not be a
more worthy member of society than his immediate
parent. Mr Walter Scott, born in 1729, and admitted
as a Writer to the Signet in 1755, was by no means a
man of shining abilities. He was, however, a steady,
expert man of business, insomuch as to prosper considerably
in life; and nothing could exceed the gentleness,
sincerity, and benevolence of his character. For
many years, he held the honourable office of an elder
in the parish church of Old Greyfriars, while Dr
Robertson, the historian of <i>America</i> and <i>Charles V.</i>,
acted as one of the ministers. The other clergyman was
Dr John Erskine, much more distinguished as a divine,
and of whom Sir Walter has given an animated picture
in his novel of <i>Guy Mannering</i>. The latter person led
the more zealous party of the Church of Scotland, in
opposition to his colleague, Dr Robertson, who swayed
the moderate and predominating party; and it is
believed that, although a Jacobite, and employed mostly
by that party, the religious impressions of Mr Scott
were more akin to the doctrines maintained by Erskine,
than those professed by Robertson.</p>

<p>Mrs Scott, while she boasted a less prepossessing
exterior than her husband, was enabled, partly by the
more literary character of her connections and education,
and more perhaps by native powers of intellect,
to make a greater impression in conversation. It has
thus become a conceded point, that Sir Walter derived<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">6</span>
his abilities almost exclusively from this parent. Without
pretending to judge in a matter of such delicacy, it
may at least be allowed that the young poet was at
first greatly indebted to his mother for an introduction
to the literary society of which her father and brother
were such distinguished ornaments. It has somewhere
been alleged that Mrs Scott, who was an intimate
friend of Allan Ramsay, Blacklock, and other poetical
wits of the last century, wrote verses, like them, in the
vernacular language of Scotland. But this can be
denied, upon the testimony of her own son. The
mistake has probably arisen in consequence of a Mrs
Scott of Wauchope, whose maiden name was likewise
Rutherford, having published poetry of her own composition.
Mrs Walter Scott, who was altogether a woman
of the highest order of intellect and character, was, at
an early age, deemed worthy by her father to be intrusted
with the charge of his house, during his temporary
widowhood; and thus she possessed opportunities enjoyed
by few young ladies of her own age, and of the
period when she lived, of mixing in literary society. It
is unquestionable that this circumstance was likely to
have some effect in later life upon her son, with the
training of whose mind she must, in virtue of her
maternal character, have had more to do than her
husband. It may be further mentioned that Mrs Scott
had been principally educated by a reduced gentlewoman,
a Mrs Euphemia Sinclair (grand-daughter of Sir
Robert Sinclair of Longformacus), who kept a school
for young ladies in the now wretched precincts of
Blackfriars’ Wynd, in Edinburgh, and who had the
honour of educating many of the female nobility and
gentry of Scotland, some of whom were her own<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">7</span>
relations. Sir Walter’s own words respecting this
person are given in the work entitled <i>Traditions of
Edinburgh</i>: ‘To judge by the proficiency of her
scholars, although much of what is called accomplishment
might then be left untaught, she must have been
possessed of uncommon talents for education; for all
the ladies above mentioned’ [the list includes Mrs
Scott] ‘had well-cultivated minds, were fond of reading,
wrote and spelled admirably, were well acquainted with
history and with the belles-lettres, without neglecting
the more homely duties of the needle and accompt-book;
and, while two of them’ [meaning, as there is
reason to believe, Mrs Scott, and Mrs Murray Keith,
the Mrs Bethune Baliol of the <i>Chronicles of the Canongate</i>]
‘were women of extraordinary talents, all of them
were perfectly well bred in society.’ Sir Walter further
communicated that his mother, and many others of
Mrs Sinclair’s pupils, were sent, according to a fashion
then prevalent in good society, to be <em>finished off</em> by
the Honourable Mrs Ogilvie, lady of the Honourable
Patrick Ogilvie of Longmay, whose brother, the Earl
of Seafield, was so instrumental, as Chancellor of
Scotland, in carrying through the union with England.
Mrs Ogilvie trained her young friends to a style of
manners which would now be considered intolerably
stiff; for instance, no young lady, in sitting, was permitted
ever to touch the back of her chair. Such was
the effect of this early training upon the mind of Mrs
Scott, that even when she approached her eightieth
year, she took as much care to avoid touching her chair
with her back as if she had still been under the stern
eye of Mrs Ogilvie.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="toclink_8">BIRTH—BIRTHPLACE—EARLY SCENES.</h2>
</div>

<p>Sir Walter Scott was born at Edinburgh on the 15th
of August 1771, being the birthday of the great European
hero [Napoleon] whose deeds he was afterwards
to record. He was the third of a family consisting of
six sons and one daughter. The eldest son, John,
attained to a captaincy in an infantry regiment, but was
early obliged to retire from service on account of the
delicate state of his health. Another elder brother,
Daniel, was a sailor, but died in early life. Of him
Sir Walter has often been heard to assert, that he was
by far the cleverest and most interesting of the whole.
Thomas, the next brother to Sir Walter, followed the
father’s profession, and was for some years factor to the
Marquis of Abercorn, but eventually died in Canada in
1822, in the capacity of paymaster to the 70th Regiment.
Sir Walter himself entertained a fondly high
opinion of the talents of this brother; but it is not borne
out by the sense of his other friends. He possessed,
however, some burlesque humour, and an acquaintance
with Scottish manners and character—qualities which
were apt to impose a little, and even induced some
individuals to believe, for some time, that he, rather than
his more gifted brother, was the author of ‘The Novels.’</p>

<p>Existence opened upon the author of <i>Waverley</i> in one
of the duskiest parts of the ancient capital, which he has
been pleased to apostrophise in <i>Marmion</i> as his ‘own
romantic town.’ At the time of his birth, and for some
time after, his father lived at the head of the College
Wynd, a narrow alley leading from the Cowgate to the
gate of the college. The two lower flats of the house
were occupied by Mr Keith, W.S., grandfather of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">9</span>
Knight Marischal of Scotland, and Mr Walter Scott
lodged on the third floor, his part of the mansion being
accessible by a stair behind.</p>

<p>It was a house of what would now be considered
humble aspect, but at that time neither humble from its
individual appearance nor from its vicinage. As it
stood on the line necessary for the opening of a street
along the north skirt of the new university buildings, it
was destroyed on that occasion, and never rebuilt.
Speaking of this house in a series of notes communicated
to a local antiquary in 1825, Sir Walter said: ‘It consisted
of two flats above Mr Keith’s, and belonged to
my father, Mr Walter Scott, Writer to the Signet; there
I had the chance to be born, 15th August 1771. My
father, soon after my birth, removed to George’s Square,
and let the house in the College Wynd, first to Mr
Dundas of Philipstoun, and afterwards to Mr William
Keith, father of Sir Alexander Keith. It was purchased
by the public, together with Mr Keith’s’ [the inferior
floors], ‘and pulled down to make way for the new
college.’</p>

<p>It appears, however, that, before Sir Walter could
receive any impressions from the romantic scenery of
the Old Town of Edinburgh, he was removed, on
account of the delicacy of his health, to the country,
and lived for a considerable period under the charge of
his paternal grandfather at Sandyknow. This farm is
situated upon high ground, near the bottom of Leader
Water, and overlooks a large part of the vale of Tweed.
In the immediate neighbourhood of the farm-house,
upon a rocky foundation, stood the Border fortlet
called Smailholm Tower, which possessed many features
to attract the attention of the young poet. It was his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">10</span>
early residence at this romantic spot that imparted an
intense affection for the southern part of Scotland, to
which he finally adjourned. Some account of the district
which he so dearly loved may here properly be given.</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="toclink_10">THE LAND OF SCOTT.</h2>
</div>

<p>The district which this mighty genius has appropriated
as his own, may be described as restricted in a great
measure to the counties of Roxburgh and Selkirk, the
former of which is the central part of the frontier or
Border of Scotland, noted of old for the warlike character
of its inhabitants, and even, till a comparatively
late period, for certain predatory habits, unlike anything
that obtained at the same time, at least in the southern
portion of Scotland. Though born in Edinburgh,
Walter Scott was descended from Roxburghshire families,
and was familiar in his early years with both the scenery
and the inhabitants, and the history and traditions,
of that romantic land. He was indeed fed with the
legendary lore of the Borders as with a mother’s milk;
and it was this, no doubt, which gave his mind so
remarkable a taste for the manners of the middle ages,
to the exclusion of all sympathy for either the ideas of
the ancient classics, or the literature of modern manners.
There was something additionally engaging to a mind
like his in the poetical associations which have so long
rendered this region the very Arcadia of Scotland. The
Tweed, flowing majestically from one end of it to the
other; the Teviot, a scarcely less noble tributary; with
all the lesser streams connected with these two—the
Jed, the Gala, the Ettrick, the Yarrow, and the Quair—had,
from the revival of Scottish poetry, been sung by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">11</span>
unnumbered bards, many of whose names have perished,
like flowers, from the face of the earth which they
adorned. From all these associations mingled together,
did the mind of this transcendent genius draw its first
and its happiest inspiration.</p>

<p>The general character of this district of Scotland is
pastoral. Here and there, along the banks of the
streams, there are alluvial strips called <em>haughs</em>, all of
which are finely cultivated; and the plough, in many
places, has ascended the hill to a considerable height;
but the land in general is a succession of pastoral
eminences, which are either green to the top, or swathed
in dusky heath, unless where a patch of young and green
wood seeks to soften the climate and the soil. Much
of the land still belongs to the Duke of Buccleuch, and
other descendants of noted Border chiefs, and it annually
supplies much of what both clothes and feeds the British
population. Being little intruded upon by manufactures,
or any other thing calculated to introduce new ideas,
its population exhibit, in general, those primitive features
of character which are so invariably found to characterise
a pastoral people. Even where, in such cases
as Hawick and Galashiels, manufactures have established
an isolated seat, the people are hardly distinguishable,
in simplicity and homely virtues, from the tenants
of the hills.</p>

<p>Starting at Kelso upon an excursion over this country,
the traveller would soon reach Roxburgh, where the
Teviot and the Tweed are joined—a place noted in
early Scottish history for the importance of its town
and castle, now alike swept away. Pursuing upwards
the course of the Teviot, he would first be tempted
aside into the sylvan valley of the Jed, on the banks<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">12</span>
of which stands the ancient and picturesque town of
Jedburgh, and whose beauties have been rapturously
described by Thomson, who spent many of his youngest
and happiest years amidst its beautiful <em>braes</em>. Farther
up, the Teviot is joined by the Aill, and, farther up still,
by the Rule, a rivulet whose banks were once occupied
almost exclusively by the warlike clans of Turnbull and
Rutherford. Next is the Slitrig, and next the Borthwick;
after which, the accessories of this mountain
stream cease to be distinguished. Every stream has
its valley; every valley has its particular class of inhabitants—its
own tales, songs, and traditions; and when
the traveller contrasts its noble hills and clear trotting
<em>burnies</em> with the tame landscapes of ‘merry England,’
he is at no loss to see how the natives of a mountainous
region come to distinguish their own country so much
in poetical recollection, and behold it with such exclusive
love. When the Englishman is absent from his
home, he sees a scene not greatly different from what he
is accustomed to, and regards his absence with very
little feeling. But when a native of these secluded vales
visits another district, he finds an alien peculiarity in
every object; the hills are of a different height and
vesture; the streams are different in size, or run in a
different direction. Everything tells him that he is not
at home. And, when returning to his own glen, how
every distant hill-top comes out to his sight as a familiar
and companionable object! How every less prominent
feature reminds him of that place which, of all the earth,
he calls <em>his own</em>! Even when he crosses what is termed
the height of the country, and but sees the waters running
<em>towards</em> that cherished place, his heart is distended
with a sense of home and kindred, and he throws his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">13</span>
very soul upon the stream, that it may be carried before
him to the spot where he has garnered up all his most
valued affections.</p>

<p>There is one part of Roxburghshire which does not
belong to the great vale of the Tweed, and yet is as
essentially as any a part of the Land of Scott. This
is Liddesdale, or the vale of the Liddel, a stream which
seeks the Solway, and forms part of the more westerly
border. Nothing out of Spain could be more wild or
lonely than this pastoral vale, which once harboured
the predatory clans of Elliot and Armstrong, but is now
occupied by a race of more than usually primitive sheep-farmers.
It is absolutely overrun with song and legend,
of which Sir Walter Scott reaped an ample harvest for
his <i>Border Minstrelsy</i>, including the fine old ballads of
<i>Dick o’ the Cow</i> and <i>Jock o’ the Syde</i>.</p>

<p>It may be said, indeed, that, of all places in the south
of Scotland, the attention of the great novelist was first
fixed upon Liddesdale. In his second literary effort—the
<i>Lay of the Last Minstrel</i>—he confined himself in
a great measure to Teviotdale, in the upper part of
which, about three miles above Hawick, stands Branxholm
Castle, the chief scene of the poem. The old
house has been much altered since the supposed era of
the <i>Lay</i>; but it has nevertheless more of an ancient
than a modern appearance, and does not much disappoint
a modern beholder. For a long time, the Buccleuch
family have left it to the occupancy of the
individuals who act as their agents or chamberlains on
this part of their extensive property; and it is at present
kept in the best order, and surrounded by some fine
woods of ancient and modern growth. Seated on a
lofty bank, it still overlooks that stream, and is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">14</span>
overtopped by those hills, to which, it will be recollected,
‘the lady’ successively addressed her witching
incantations.</p>

<p>The small vale of Borthwick Water, which starts off
from the strath of the Teviot a little above Hawick, contains
a scene which cannot well be overlooked—namely,
Harden Castle, the original though now deserted seat
of the family of Scott of Harden, from which, through
the Raeburn branch, Sir Walter Scott was descended.
This, though neglected alike by its proprietor and by
tourists, is one of the most remarkable pieces of scenery
which we, who have travelled over nearly the whole of
Scotland, have yet seen within its shores. Conceive,
first, the lonely pastoral beauty of the vale of Borthwick;
next, a minor vale receding from its northern side,
full of old and emaciated, but still beautiful wood:
penetrating this recess for a little way, the traveller sees,
perched upon a lofty height in front, and beaming
perhaps in the sun, a house which, though not picturesque
in its outline, derives that quality in a high degree from
its situation and accompaniments. This is Harden
House or Castle; but, though apparently near it, the
wayfarer has yet to walk a long way around the height
before he can wind his way into its immediate presence.
When arrived at the platform whereon the house stands,
he finds it degraded into a farm-house; its court forming
perhaps a temporary cattle-yard; every ornament disgraced;
every memorial of former grandeur seen through
a slough of plebeian utility and homeliness, or broken
into ruin. A pavement of black and white diced
marble is found in the vestibule, every square of which
is bruised to pieces, and the whole strewed with the
details of a dairy. The dining-room, a large apartment<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">15</span>
with a richly ornamented stucco roof, is now used as the
farmer’s kitchen. Other parts of the house, still bearing
the arms and initials of Walter Scott, Earl of Tarras,
great-grandfather of the late Mr Scott of Harden, and
of his second wife, Helen Hepburn, are sunk in a
scarcely less proportion. This nobleman was at first
married to Mary, Countess of Buccleuch, who died,
however, without issue, leaving the succession open to
her sister Anne, who became the wife of the unfortunate
Duke of Monmouth, eldest natural son of Charles II.
Through this family connection, the Earl of Tarras was
induced to join in the conspiracy which usually bears
the name of the Rye-house Plot, for which he was
attainted, only saving his life by giving evidence against
his more steadfast companion, Baillie of Jerviswood, the
great-grandfather of another Scottish proprietor, who
happened to be an immediate neighbour of Harden.
It may be asked why Mr Scott did not inherit the title
of his ancestor: the answer is, that it was only thought
necessary to invest the husband of the Countess of
Buccleuch with a title for his own life—which proves
that the hereditary character of the peerage has not
always been observed in our constitution. While all of
this scene that springs from art is degraded and wretched,
it is striking to see that its natural grandeur suffers no
defalcation. The wide-sweeping hills stretch off grandly
on all hands, and the celebrated <em>den</em>, from which the
place has taken its name, still retains the features which
have rendered it so remarkable a natural curiosity.
This is a large abyss in the earth, as it may be called,
immediately under the walls of the house, and altogether
unpervaded by running water—the banks clothed with
trees of all kinds, and one side opening to the vale,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">16</span>
though the bottom is much beneath the level of the
surrounding ground. Old Wat of Harden—such is the
popular name of an aged marauder celebrated in the
<i>Minstrelsy of the Scottish Border</i>—used to keep the large
herds which he had draughted out of the northern
counties of England in this strange hollow; and it
seems to have been admirably adapted for the purpose.
It was this Border hero of whom the story is told
somewhere by his illustrious descendant, that, coming
once homeward with a goodly prey of cattle, and seeing
a large haystack standing in a farm-yard by the way,
he could not help saying, with some bitterness: ‘By my
saul, an ye had four feet, ye should gang too!’</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="toclink_16">SCHOOL-BOY DAYS.</h2>
</div>

<p>It is understood that, at the ‘evening fire’ of Sandyknow,
Sir Walter learned much of that Border lore
which he afterwards wrought up in his fictions. To
what extent his residence there retarded his progress in
school instruction, is not discovered. After being at
Sandyknow, he was, for the sake of the mineral waters,
sent, in his fourth year, to Bath, where he attended
a dame’s school, and received his first lessons in
reading. Returning to Edinburgh, he made some
advances in the rudiments of learning at a private
school kept by a Mr Leechman in Hamilton’s Entry,
Bristo Street [now a small, decayed building, with a
tiled roof, occupied by a working blacksmith]. This
was his first school in Edinburgh. It is almost
certain that his attendance at school was rendered
irregular by his delicate health. He entered Fraser’s
class at the High School in the <em>third year</em>—that is to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">17</span>
say, when that master had carried his class through one
half of the ordinary curriculum of the school; wherefore
it is clear that any earlier instruction he could have
received must have been in some inferior institution,
and very probably communicated in a hurried and
imperfect manner. It is at the commencement of the
school year in October 1779 that his name first appears
in the school register: he must have then been eight
years of age, which, it may be remarked, is an unusually
early period for a boy to enter the third year of
his classical course. What is further remarkable, his
elder brother attended the same class. It is therefore
to be suspected that his educational interests
were sacrificed, in some measure, to the circumstances
of the school, which were at that period in
such an unhappy arrangement as to teachers, that
parents often precipitated their children into a class
for which they were unfitted, in order to escape a
teacher whom they deemed unqualified for his duties,
and secure the instructions of one who bore a superior
character.</p>

<p>Although Mr Luke Fraser was one of the severest
flagellators even of the <em>old school</em>, he enjoyed the
reputation of being a sound scholar, so far as scholarship
was required for his duties, and also that of
a most conscientious and painstaking teacher. He
first caused his scholars to get by heart Ruddiman’s
<i>Rudiments</i>, and as soon as they were thoroughly
grounded in the declensions, the Vocabulary of the
same great grammarian was put into their hands, and
a small number of words prescribed to be repeated
every morning. They then read in succession the
<i>Colloquies</i> of Corderius, four or five lives of Cornelius<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">18</span>
Nepos, and the first four books of Cæsar’s <i>Commentaries</i>.
Ere this course was perfected, the greater part of
Ruddiman’s <i>Grammatica Minora</i>, in Latin, was got by
heart. Select passages from Ovid’s <i>Metamorphoses</i>, the
<i>Bucolics</i> and the first <i>Æneid</i> of Virgil, concluded the
fourth year; after which the boys were turned over to
the rector, by whom they were instructed for two years
more; making the course in all six years. It must
also be understood, that every one of the three masters
besides Mr Fraser pursued the same system, bringing
forward a class from the first elements to the state in
which it was fitted for the attention of the rector; after
which he returned once more to take up a new set of
boys in the first class—and so forth for one lustrum
after another, so long as he was connected with the
school. If any teacher could have brought a boy over
such a difficulty as that which attended the commencement
of Sir Walter’s career at the High School, it
would have been Mr Fraser; for few of his profession
at that time were more anxious to explain away every
obstruction in the path of his pupils, or took so much
pains to ascertain that they were carrying the understandings
of the boys along with them through all the
successive stages. Apparently, however, neither the
care of the master nor the inborn genius of the pupil
availed much in this case, for it is said that the twenty-fifth
place was no uncommon situation in the class for
the future author of the Waverley Novels.</p>

<p>After two years of instruction, commenced under
these unfavourable circumstances, Sir Walter, in October
1781, entered the rector’s class, then taught by Dr
Alexander Adam, the author of many excellent elementary
books, and one of the most meritorious and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">19</span>
most eminent teachers that Scotland has ever produced.
The authors read by Dr Adam’s class at this period,
and probably during the whole of his career, were Virgil,
Horace, Cicero, Sallust, Livy, and Terence; but it was
not in reading and translating alone that an education
under this eminent man consisted. Adam, who was an
indefatigable student, as the number and excellence of
his works testify, was a complete contrast to Mr Fraser.
The latter hardly ever introduced a single remark but
what was intended to illustrate the <em>letter</em> of the author;
whereas Dr Adam commented at great length upon
whatever occurred in the course of reading in the class,
whether it related to antiquities, customs, and manners,
or to history. He was of so communicative a disposition,
that whatever knowledge he had acquired in his
private studies, he took the first opportunity of imparting
to his class, paying little regard whether it was above
the comprehension of the greater number of his scholars
or not. He abounded in pleasant anecdote; and while
he never neglected the proper business of his class, it
is certain that he inspired a far higher love of knowledge
and of literary history into the minds of his pupils than
any other teacher of his day. At the same time, he
displayed a benevolence of character which won the
hearts of his pupils, and nothing ever gave him so much
pleasure as to hear of their success in after-life. To
this venerable person, Sir Walter was always ready to
acknowledge his obligations, and it is not improbable
that much of his literary character was moulded on that
of Dr Adam.</p>

<p>As a scholar, nevertheless, the subject of this memoir
never became remarkable for proficiency. There is his
own authority for saying, that, even in the exercise of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">20</span>
metrical translation, he fell far short of some of his
companions; although others preserve a somewhat
different recollection, and state that this was a department
in which he always manifested a superiority. It
is, however, unquestionable, that in his exercises he was
remarkable, to no inconsiderable extent, for blundering
and incorrectness; his mind apparently not possessing
that aptitude for mastering small details, in which so
much of scholarship, in its earliest stages, consists.</p>

<p>Regarding his school-days, we may introduce an
extract from an original letter on the subject. ‘The
following lines were written by Walter Scott when he
was between ten and eleven years of age, and while
he was attending the High School, Edinburgh. His
master there had spoken of him as a remarkably stupid
boy, and his mother with grief acknowledged that they
spoke truly. She saw him one morning, in the midst of
a tremendous thunder-storm, standing still in the street,
and looking at the sky. She called to him repeatedly,
but he remained looking upwards without taking the
least notice of her. When he returned into the house,
she was very much displeased with him: “Mother,” he
said, “I could tell you the reason why I stood still, and
why I looked at the sky, if you would only give me a
pencil.” She gave him one, and, in less than five
minutes, he laid a bit of paper on her lap, with these
words written on it:</p>

<div class="poetry-container w20">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indentq">“Loud o’er my head what awful thunders roll,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">What vivid lightnings flash from pole to pole,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">It is thy voice, my God, that bids them fly,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Thy voice directs them through the vaulted sky;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Then let the good thy mighty power revere,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Let hardened sinners thy just judgments fear.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">21</span></p>
<p class="in0">The old lady repeated them to me herself, and the tears
were in her eyes: for I really believe, simple as they
are, that she values these lines, being the first effusion
of her son’s genius, more than any later beauties which
have so charmed all the world besides.’</p>

<p>Before quitting the High School, he, along with his
brothers, received the advantages of some tutorial training
under a Mr Mitchell, who afterwards became a minister
connected with the Scotch Church. Previous to entering
the university of Edinburgh, young Walter spent some
time with his aunt at Kelso. Here, in order that he
might be kept up in his classical studies, he attended
the grammar-school, at that time under the rectorship
of Mr Lancelot Whale, a worthy man and good scholar,
who possessed traits of character not unlike some of
those which have been depicted in Dominie Sampson.
It was while thus residing for a short time at Kelso,
about 1783, that Sir Walter made the acquaintance of
James Ballantyne, then a schoolboy of his own age, with
kindred literary tastes.</p>

<p>Sir Walter’s education being irregular from bad health,
he did not distinguish himself as a scholar, yet often
surprised his instructors by the miscellaneous knowledge
which he possessed, and now and then was acknowledged
to display a sense of the beauties of the Latin
authors such as is seldom seen in boys. In the rough
amusements which went on out of school, his spirit
enabled him to take a leading share, notwithstanding his
lameness. He would help to man the Cowgate Port in
a snow-ball match, and pass the Kittle Nine Steps on
the Castle Rock with the best of them. In the winter
evenings, when out-of-door exercise was not attractive, he
would gather his companions round him at the fireside,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">22</span>
and entertain them with stories, real and imaginary, of
which he seemed to have an endless store. Unluckily,
his classical studies, neglected as they comparatively
were, experienced an interruption from bad health, just
as he was beginning to acquire some sense of their
value.</p>

<p>It would, nevertheless, be difficult to say whether
Scott was the worse or the better of the interruptions he
experienced in school learning. He lost a certain kind
of knowledge, it is true, but he gained another. The
vacant time at his disposal he gave to general reading.
History, travels, poetry, and prose fiction he devoured
without discrimination, unless it were that he preferred
imaginative literature to every other; and of all imaginative
writers, was fondest of such as Spenser, whose
knights and ladies, and dragons and giants, he was never
tired of contemplating. Any passage of a favourite poet
which pleased him particularly was sure to remain on his
memory, and thus he was able to astonish his friends
with his poetical recitations. At the same time, he
admits that solidly useful matters had a poor chance of
being remembered. His sober-minded parents and
other friends regarded these acquirements without pride
or satisfaction; they marvelled at the thirst for reading
and the powers of memory, but thought it all to little
good purpose, and only excused it in consideration of
the infirm health of the young prodigy. Scott himself
lived to lament the indifference he shewed to that
regular mental discipline which is to be acquired at
school. He says in his autobiography: ‘It is with
the deepest regret that I recollect in my manhood
the opportunities of study which I neglected in my
youth; through every part of my literary career, I have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">23</span>
felt pinched and hampered by my own ignorance; and
I would at this moment give half the reputation I have
had the good-fortune to acquire, if by doing so I could
rest the remaining part upon a solid foundation of
learning and science.’</p>

<p>It is the tradition of the family—and the fact is
countenanced by this propensity to tales of chivalric
adventure—that Sir Walter wished at this period of his
life to become a soldier. The illness, however, which
had beset his early years rendered this wish bootless,
even although his parents had been inclined to gratify
it. His malady had had the effect of contracting his
right leg, so that he could hardly walk erect, even with
the toes of that foot upon the ground. It has been
related by a member of his family that, on this being
represented to him as an insuperable obstacle to his
entering the army, he left the room in an agony of
mortified feeling, and was found some time afterwards
suspended by the wrists from his bedroom window,
somewhat after the manner of the unfortunate Knight of
the Rueful Countenance, when beguiled by the treacherous
Maritornes at the inn. On being asked the cause
of this strange proceeding, he said he wished to prove
to them that, however unfitted by his limbs for the profession
of a soldier, he was at least strong enough in the
arms. He had actually remained in that uneasy and
trying posture for upwards of an hour.</p>

<p>His parents made many efforts to cure his lameness.
Edinburgh at this time boasted of an ingenious mechanist
in leather, the first person who extended the use of that
commodity beyond ordinary purposes; on which account
there is an elaborate memoir of him in Dodsley’s <i>Annual
Register</i> for 1793. His name was Gavin Wilson, and,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">24</span>
being something of a humorist, he exhibited a sign-board
intended to burlesque the vanity of his brother-tradesmen—his
profession being thus indicated: ‘Leather leg-maker,
<em>not</em> to his Majesty.’ Honest Gavin, on the
application of his parents, did all he could for Sir
Walter, but in vain.</p>

<p>An attempt was made about the same time to give
him instructions in music, which used to be a branch of
ordinary education in Scotland. His preceptor was Mr
Alexander Campbell, then organist of an Episcopal
chapel in Edinburgh, but known in later life as the
editor of <i>Albyn’s Anthology</i>, and author of various other
publications. Mr Campbell’s efforts were entirely in
vain: he had to abandon his pupil in a short time, with
the declaration, that he was totally deficient in that
indispensable requisite to a musical education—an <em>ear</em>.
It may appear strange, that he who wrote so many
musical verses, should have wanted this natural gift;
but there are other cases to shew that a perception of
metrical quantities does not depend on any such
peculiarity. Dr Johnson is a splendid instance.
Throughout life, Sir Walter, however capable of enjoying
music, was incapable of producing two notes
consecutively that were either in tune or in time. He
used to be pressed, however, at an annual agricultural
dinner, to contribute his proper quota to the cantations
of the evening; on which occasions he would break
forth with the song of <i>Tarry Woo</i>, in a strain of
unmusical vehemence, which never failed, on the same
principle as Dick Tinto’s ill-painted sign, to put the
company into good-humour.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="toclink_25">UNIVERSITY.</h2>
</div>

<p>Sir Walter was placed in the University of Edinburgh,
October 1783. The usual course at this famed
seminary is, for the first year, to attend the classes of
Latin and Greek, to which, during the second, are added
Mathematics and Logic; the third and last year of the
course of a merely liberal education is spent in attending
the lectures on Moral and Natural Philosophy. It
would appear that Sir Walter did not proceed regularly
through this academical course. He was matriculated,
or booked, in 1783, at once for the Humanity or Latin
class under Professor Hill, and the Greek class under
Professor Dalyell; and for the latter, once more in
1784. But the only other class for which he seems to
have matriculated at the college was that of Logic,
under Professor Bruce, in 1785. Although he may
perhaps have attended other classes without matriculation,
there is reason to believe that his irregular health
produced a corresponding irregularity in his academical
studies. The result, it is to be feared, was, that he
entered life much in the condition of his illustrious
prototype, the Bard of Avon—that is, ‘with a little
Latin and less Greek.’</p>

<p>Between his twelfth and fifteenth year, young Scott
had a particularly favourite companion of his own age,
John Irvine, the mutual attraction being a love of
fictions of a chivalrous description, furnished by an
eminent circulating library, which had been founded in
Edinburgh by Allan Ramsay, and situated in the High
Street, a short way above the Tron Church, and then
belonged to Mr James Sibbald, a person of literary
tastes, who edited the <i>Edinburgh Magazine</i>, and a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">26</span>
collection of Scottish poetry. This old-fashioned library,
the first of its kind, passed in time into the hands of
Mr Alexander Mackay; and was finally sold off in
1831. With a volume from this precious repository,
the two youths sometimes adjourned to the picturesque
sides of Arthur’s Seat, where, seated together so as to
read from the same page, they revelled in the adventures
of heroes and heroines of romance.</p>

<p>It will thus be observed that Sir Walter’s acquirements
in his early years did not lie nearly so much in
ordinary branches of education, as in a large stock of
miscellaneous reading, taken up at the dictation of his
own taste. His thirst for reading is perhaps not described
in sufficiently emphatic terms, even in the above narrative.
It amounted to an enthusiasm. He was at that
time very much in the house of his uncle, Dr Rutherford,
at foot of Hyndford’s Close, near the Netherbow,
and there, even at breakfast, he would constantly have a
book open by his side, to refer to while sipping his
coffee, like his own Oldbuck in the <i>Antiquary</i>. His
uncle frequently commanded him to lay aside his book
while eating, and Sir Walter would only ask permission
first to read out the paragraph in which he was engaged.
But no sooner was one paragraph ended than another
was begun, so that the doctor never could find that
his nephew finished a paragraph in his life. It may
be mentioned that Shakspeare was at this period frequently
in his hands, and that, of all the plays, the
<i>Merchant of Venice</i> was his principal favourite.</p>

<p>Another choice companion at this period was
young Adam Ferguson—afterwards known as Sir Adam
Ferguson—son of Dr Adam Ferguson, author of the
<i>History of the Roman Republic</i>, and who remained an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">27</span>
intimate friend during life. The house of Dr Ferguson
was a villa situated on the east side of a southern
suburb of Edinburgh, called <i>The Sciennes</i>, from its
proximity to the remains of an ancient monastery,
dedicated to St Catherine of Sienna. Dr Ferguson’s
house is remarkable as that in which young Walter
Scott had an opportunity of being in the company of
Robert Burns. Scott had read Burns’s poetry, and he
ardently desired to see the poet. An opportunity was
at length furnished, when Burns, on visiting Edinburgh
in 1787, came by invitation to the residence of Dr
Ferguson. Of the meeting, Scott has communicated an
unaffected description to Mr Lockhart. Sir Adam
Ferguson favoured me with some particulars of the visit
of Burns to his father’s house on this occasion.</p>

<p>It was the custom of Dr Ferguson to have a conversazione
at his house in the Sciennes once a week,
for his principal literary friends. Dr Dugald Stewart,
on this occasion, offered to bring Burns, a proposal to
which Dr Ferguson readily assented. The poet found
himself amongst the most brilliant literary society which
Edinburgh then afforded. Sir Adam thought that Black,
Hutton, and John Home were among those present.
He had himself brought his young friend Walter Scott,
as yet unnoted by his seniors. Burns seemed at first
little inclined to mingle easily in the company; he went
about the room, looking at the pictures on the walls.
The print described by Scott, from a painting by
Bunbury, attracted his attention. It represented a sad
picture of the effects of war: a soldier lying stretched
dead on the snow, his dog sitting in misery on one
side, while on the other sat his widow, nursing a child
in her arms. The print was plain, yet touching;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">28</span>
beneath were written the following lines, which Burns
read aloud:</p>

<div class="poetry-container w20">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indentsq">‘Cold on Canadian hills or Minden’s plain,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Perhaps that parent mourned her soldier slain;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Bent o’er her babe, her eye dissolved in dew,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The big drops mingling with the milk he drew,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Gave the sad presage of his future years,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The child of misery baptised in tears.’</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="in0">Before getting to the end of the lines, Burns’s voice
faltered, and his big black eye filled with tears. A little
after, he turned with much interest to the company,
pointed to the picture, and, with some eagerness, asked
if any one could tell him who had written these
affecting lines. The philosophers were silent—no one
knew; but, after a decent interval, the pale lame boy
near by said in a negligent manner: ‘They’re written
by one Langhorne.’ An explanation of the place where
they occur (poem of <i>The Country Justice</i>) followed, and
Burns fixed a look of half-serious interest on the youth,
while he said: ‘You’ll be a man yet, sir.’ Scott may
be said to have derived literary ordination from Burns.
Somewhat oddly, the name Langhorne is quoted at the
bottom of the lines, but in so small a character that the
poet might well fail to read it.<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">1</a></p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="toclink_28">PROFESSION.</h2>
</div>

<p>About his sixteenth year, Sir Walter’s health experienced
a sudden but most decisive change for the better.
Though his lameness remained the same, his body<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">29</span>
became tall and robust, and he was thus enabled to
apply himself with the necessary degree of energy to his
studies for the bar. At the same time that he attended
the Lectures of Professor Dick on Civil Law in the
college, he performed the duties of a writer’s apprentice
under his father; that being the most approved method
by which a barrister could acquire a technical knowledge
of his profession, though it has never been uniformly
practised.</p>

<p>Respect for his parents and for the common duties
of life, was always a strong feeling in Scott; he therefore
applied himself without a murmur to the desk in
his father’s office, though he acknowledges that the
recess beneath was generally stuffed with his favourite
books, from which, at intervals, he would ‘snatch a
fearful joy.’ He even made his diligence in copying
law-papers a means of gratifying his intellectual passions,
often writing an unusual quantity, that with the result
he might purchase some book or object of virtù which
he wished to possess. It should be mentioned that the
little room assigned to him on the kitchen-floor of his
father’s house in George Square was already made a
kind of museum by his taste for curiosities, especially
those of an antiquarian nature. He never was heard
to grudge the years he had spent in his father’s painstaking
business; on the contrary, he recollected them
with pleasure, for it was always a matter of pride with
him to be a man of business as well as a man of letters.
The discipline of the office gave him a number of little
technical habits, which he never afterwards lost. He
was, for instance, much of a formalist in the folding and
disposal of papers. The writer of this narrative recollects
folding a paper in a wrong fashion in his presence,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">30</span>
when he instantly undid it, and shewed, with a school-masterlike
nicety, but with great good-humour, the
proper way to perform this little piece of business.</p>

<p>While advancing to manhood, and during its first few
years, Scott, besides keeping up his desultory system of
reading, attended the meetings of a literary society
composed of such youths as himself. A selection of
these and of his early schoolfellows, became his ordinary
companions. Amongst them was William Clerk, son
of Mr Clerk of Eldin, and afterwards a distinguished
member of the Scottish bar. It was the pleasure of
this group of young men to take frequent rambles in the
country, visiting any ancient castle or other remarkable
object within their reach. Scott, notwithstanding
his limp, walked as stoutly, and sustained fatigue as
well, as any of them. Sometimes they would, according
to the general habits of those days, resort to taverns for
oysters and punch. Scott entered into such indulgences
without losing self-control; but he lived to think this
ill-spent time. As to other follies equally besetting to
youth, it is admitted by all his early friends that he was
in a singular degree pure and blameless. His genial
good-humour made him a favourite with his young
friends, and they could not deny his possessing much
out-of-the-way knowledge; yet it does not appear that
they saw in him any intellectual superiority, or reason
to expect the brilliant destiny which awaited him. The
tendency of all testimony from those who knew him at
this time is rather to set him down as one from whom
nothing extraordinary was to be looked for in mature
manhood.</p>

<p>We can easily see the grounds of this opinion. Scott
had not been a good scholar. He shewed none of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">31</span>
peculiarities of the young sonneteer, for poetry was not
yet developed in his nature. Any advantage he possessed
over others of his own standing lay in a kind of
learning which seemed useless. It is not, then, surprising
that he ranked only with ordinary youths, or perhaps a
little below them. It is asserted, however, by James
Ballantyne, that there was a certain firmness of understanding
in Scott, which enabled him to acquire an
ascendency over some of his companions; giving him
the power of allaying their quarrels by a few words, and
disposing them to submit to him on many other occasions.
Still, this must have looked like a quality of the
common world, and especially unconnected with literary
genius.</p>

<p>When Scott’s apprenticeship expired, the father was
willing to introduce him at once into a business which
would have yielded a tolerable income; but the youth,
stirred by ambition, preferred advancing to the bar, for
which his service in a writer’s office was the reverse of
a disqualification. Having therefore passed through
the usual studies, he was admitted of the Faculty of
Advocates, July 1792. This is a profession in which
a young man usually spends a few years to little
purpose, unless peculiar advantages in the way of
patronage help him on. Scott does not appear to have
done more for some sessions than pass creditably
enough through certain routine duties which his father
and others imposed upon him, and for which only
moderate remuneration was made. He wanted the
ready fluent address which is required for pleading, and
his knowledge of law was not such as to attract business
to him as a consulting counsel. While lingering out
the first few idle years of professional life, he studied<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">32</span>
the German language and some of its modern writers.
He also continued the same kind of antiquarian reading
for which he had already become remarkable.</p>

<p>Amongst other things giving a character to his mind,
were certain annual journeys he made into the pastoral
district of Liddesdale, where the castles of the old
Border chiefs, and the legends of their exploits, were
still rife. On these occasions, he was accompanied by
an intelligent friend, Mr Robert Shortreed, long after
sheriff-substitute at Jedburgh. No inns, and hardly any
roads, were then in Liddesdale. The farmers were a
simple race, knowing nothing of the outward world.
So much was this the case, that one honest fellow, at
whose house the travellers alighted to spend a night,
was actually frightened at the idea of meeting an
Edinburgh advocate. Willie o’ Milburn, as this hero
was called, at length took a careful survey of Scott
round a corner of the stable, and getting somewhat
reassured from the sight, said to Mr Shortreed: ‘Weel,
de’il ha’e me if I’s be a bit feared for him now; he’s
just a chield like ourselves, I think.’ On these excursions,
Scott took down from old people anecdotes of
the old rough times, and copies of the ballads in which
the adventures of the Elliots and Armstrongs were
recorded. Thus were laid the foundations of the
collection which became in time the <i>Minstrelsy of the
Scottish Border</i>. The friendship of Mr Edmonstone of
Newton led him, in like manner, to visit those districts
of Stirlingshire and lower Perthshire where he afterwards
localised his <i>Lady of the Lake</i>. There he learned much
of the more recent rough times of the Highlands, and
even conversed with one gentleman who had had to
do with Rob Roy. These things constituted the real<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">33</span>
education of Scott’s mind, as far as his character as a
literary man is concerned.</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="toclink_33">POLITICAL OPINIONS—SOLDIERING.</h2>
</div>

<p>From his earliest years, Sir Walter’s political leanings
were towards Conservatism, or that principle
which disposes men to wish for the preservation of
existing institutions, and the continuance of power in
the hands which have heretofore possessed it. ‘As
for politics,’ says Shenstone in his Letters, ‘I think
poets are Tories by nature, supposing them to be by
nature poets. The love of an individual person or
family that has worn a crown for many successions, is
an inclination greatly adapted to the fanciful tribe.
On the other hand, mathematicians, abstract reasoners,
of no manner of attachment to persons, at least to the
visible part of them, but prodigiously devoted to the
ideas of virtue, liberty, and so forth, are generally
Whigs.’ There is much in this passage that hits the
particular case of Sir Walter Scott. But moods of
political feeling are not confined to individuals—they
sometimes become nearly general over entire nations.
At the time when Sir Walter entered public life, almost
all the respectable part of the community were replete
with a Tory species of feeling in behalf of the British
constitution, as threatened by France; and numerous
bodies of volunteer militia were consequently formed,
for the purpose of local defence against invasion from
that country. In the beginning of the year 1797, it
was judged necessary by the gentlemen of Mid-Lothian
to imitate the example already set by several counties,
by embodying themselves in a cavalry corps. This<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">34</span>
association assumed the name of the Royal Mid-Lothian
Regiment of Cavalry; and Mr Walter Scott
had the honour to be appointed its adjutant, for which
office his lameness was considered no bar, especially as
he happened to be a remarkably graceful equestrian.
He was a signally zealous officer, and very popular in
the regiment, on account of his extreme good-humour
and powers of social entertainment. His appointment
partly resulted from, and partly led to, an intimacy with
the most considerable man of his name, Henry, Duke
of Buccleuch, who had taken a great interest in the
embodying of the corps. It was also perhaps the
means, to a certain extent, of making him known to Mr
Henry Dundas, who was now one of His Majesty’s
Secretaries of State, and a lively promoter of the
scheme of national defence in Scotland. Adjutant
Scott composed a war-song, as he called it, for the Mid-Lothian
Cavalry, which he afterwards published in the
<i>Border Minstrelsy</i>. It is an animated poem, and might,
as a person is <em>now</em> apt to suppose, have commanded
attention, by whomsoever written, or wherever presented
to notice. Yet, to shew how apt men are to judge of
literary compositions upon general principles, and not
with a direct reference to the particular merits of the
article, it may be mentioned that the war-song was only
a subject of ridicule to many individuals of the troop.
The individual, in particular, who communicated this
information, remembered a large party of the officers
dining together at Musselburgh, where the chief amusement,
at a certain period of the night, was to repeat
the initial line, ‘To horse, to horse!’ with burlesque
expression, and laugh at ‘this attempt of Scott’s’ as a
piece of supreme absurdity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">35</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="toclink_35">[VISIT TO PEEBLESSHIRE.</h2>
</div>

<p>In the autumn of 1797, Walter Scott, accompanied
by his brother John, and Adam Ferguson, made an
excursion to the borders of Cumberland, taking in their
way the mansion of Hallyards, in the parish of Manor,
Peeblesshire, where Dr Adam Ferguson was now temporarily
settled with his family. Here Scott resided for a
few days, visiting Barns and other places in the neighbourhood.
In a small cottage on the property of
Woodhouse resided a poor and singular recluse, dwarfed
and decrepit, by name David Ritchie, who was visited
as one of the curiosities of the district; and it was
doubtless on this occasion that Scott received those
impressions which afterwards figured in the character of
the ‘Black Dwarf.’</p>

<p>Ritchie, with all his oddities, had a deep veneration
for learning; and as he was told that Scott was a young
advocate, he invested him with extraordinary interest.
Ferguson gave an amusing account of the interview.
He and his companion were accommodated with seats in
the lowly and dingy hut. After grinning upon Scott for
a moment with a smile less bitter than his wont, the
dwarf passed to the door, double-locked it, and then,
coming up to the stranger, seized him by the wrist with
one of his hands, and said: ‘Man, hae ye ony poo’er?’
By this he meant magical power, to which he had
himself some vague pretensions, or which, at least, he
had studied and reflected upon till it had become with
him a kind of monomania. Scott disavowed the possession
of any gifts of this kind, evidently to the great
disappointment of the inquirer, who then turned round
and gave a signal to a huge black cat, hitherto<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">36</span>
unobserved, which immediately jumped up to a shelf,
where it perched itself, and seemed to the excited
senses of the visitors as if it had really been the familiar
spirit of the mansion. ‘<em>He</em> has poo’er,’ said the dwarf,
in a voice which made the flesh of the hearers thrill,
and Scott, in particular, looked as if he conceived himself
to have actually got into the den of one of those
magicians with whom his studies had rendered him
familiar. ‘Ay, he has poo’er,’ repeated the recluse, and
then going to his usual seat, he sat for some minutes
grinning horribly, as if enjoying the impression he had
made; while not a word escaped from any of the party.
Mr Ferguson at length plucked up his spirits, and called
to David to open the door, as they must now be going.
The dwarf slowly obeyed; and when they had got out,
Mr Ferguson observed that his friend was as pale as
ashes, while his person was agitated in every limb.
Under such striking circumstances was this extraordinary
being first presented to the <em>real</em> magician, who
was afterwards to give him such a deathless celebrity.</p>

<p>Before quitting the district, Scott had an opportunity
of visiting the old inn and posting establishment of
Miss Ritchie in Peebles, then, and for ten or twelve
years later, the principal place of accommodation for
travellers. Miss Ritchie, an elderly lady, was somewhat
of an original in manner, and there can be little doubt
that her peculiarities furnished such recollections as were
afterwards matured in the character of ‘Meg Dods of
the Cleikum Inn, St Ronans.’ Proceeding southwards,
the tourists at length reached Carlisle, and extended
their excursion to Penrith and other places of interest
in Cumberland, where an incident occurred that requires
more than a casual notice.]</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="toclink_37">MARRIAGE.</h2>
</div>

<p>Two children, a boy and girl, named Charpentier,
of French parentage, fell by circumstances under the
guardianship of the Marquis of Downshire. In time,
the boy received a lucrative appointment in India; on
his naturalisation as a British subject, changing his
name to Carpenter. Miss Carpenter was placed under
the charge of a governess, Miss Nicholson, and, requiring
a change of scene, was, through the kindness of
Lord Downshire, sent with her governess to Cumberland,
where she was to live in such pleasant rural spot
as might be found by the Rev. Mr Burd, Dean of
Carlisle. The two ladies arrived unexpectedly, when
Mrs Burd was setting out for the sake of her health to
Gilsland. This was at the end of the month of August
or beginning of September 1797.</p>

<p>Having duly arrived at Gilsland, which is situated
near the borders of Scotland, they took up their residence
at the inn, where, according to the custom of
such places, they were placed, as the latest guests, at
the bottom of the table. It chanced that three young
Scottish gentlemen had arrived the same afternoon,
and being also placed at the bottom of the table,
one of them happened accidentally to come into close
contact with the party of Mr Burd. Enough of conversation
took place during dinner to let the latter individuals
understand that the gentleman was a Scotchman,
and this was in itself the cause of the acquaintance
being protracted. Mrs Burd was intimate with a Scotch
military gentleman, a Major Riddell, whose regiment
was then in Scotland; and as there had been a collision
between the military and the people at Tranent, on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">38</span>
account of the Militia Act, she was anxious to know if
her friend had been among those present, or if he had
received any hurt. After dinner, therefore, as they
were rising from table, Mrs Burd requested her husband
to ask the Scotch gentleman if he knew anything of the
late riots, and particularly if a Major Riddell had been
concerned in suppressing them. On these questions
being put, it was found that the stranger knew Major
Riddell intimately, and he was able to assure them, in
very courteous terms, that his friend was quite well.
From a desire to prolong the conversation on this point,
the Burds invited their informant to drink tea with
them in their own room, to which he very readily consented,
notwithstanding that he had previously ordered
his horse to be brought to the door in order to proceed
upon his journey. At tea, their common acquaintance
with Major Riddell furnished much pleasant conversation,
and the parties became so agreeable to each other,
that, in a subsequent walk to the Wells, the stranger
still accompanied Mr Burd’s party. He had now
ordered his horse back to the stable, and talked no
more of continuing his journey. It may be easily
imagined that a desire of discussing the major was not
<em>now</em> the sole bond of union between the parties. Mr
Scott—for so he gave his name—had been impressed,
during the earlier part of the evening, with the elegant
and fascinating appearance of Miss Carpenter, and it
was on her account that he was lingering at Gilsland.
Of this young lady, it will be observed, he could have
previously known nothing: she was hardly known even
to the respectable persons under whose protection she
appeared to be living. She was simply a lovely woman,
and a young poet was struck with her charms.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">39</span></p>

<p>Next day Mr Scott was still found at the Wells—and
the next—and the next—in short, every day for a
fortnight. He was as much in the company of Mr Burd
and his family as the equivocal foundation of their
acquaintance would allow; and by affecting an intention
of speedily visiting the Lakes, he even contrived to
obtain an invitation to the dean’s country house in
that part of England. In the course of this fortnight,
the impression made upon his heart by the young
Frenchwoman was gradually deepened; and it is not
improbable that the effect was already in some degree
reciprocal. He only tore himself away, in consequence
of a call to attend certain imperative matters of business
at Edinburgh.</p>

<p>It was not long ere he made his appearance at Mr
Burd’s house, where, though the dean had only contemplated
a passing visit, as from a tourist, he contrived to
enjoy another fortnight of Miss Carpenter’s society. In
order to give a plausible appearance to his intercourse
with the young lady, he was perpetually talking to her
in French, for the ostensible purpose of perfecting his
pronunciation of that language under the instructions of
one to whom it was a vernacular. Though delighted
with the lively conversation of the young Scotchman,
Mr and Mrs Burd could not now help feeling uneasy
about his proceedings, being apprehensive as to the
construction which Lord Downshire would put upon
them, as well as upon their own conduct in admitting a
person of whom they knew so little to the acquaintance
of his ward. Miss Nicholson’s sentiments were, if
possible, of a still more painful kind, as, indeed, her
responsibility was more onerous and delicate. In this
dilemma, it was resolved by Mrs Burd to write to a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">40</span>
friend in Edinburgh, in order to learn something of
the character and status of their guest. The answer
returned was to the effect that Mr Scott was a respectable
young man, and rising at the bar. It chanced at
the same time that one of Mr Scott’s female friends,
who did not, however, entertain this respectful notion
of him, hearing of some love adventure in which he
had been entangled at Gilsland, wrote to this very Mrs
Burd, with whom she was acquainted, inquiring if she
had heard of such a thing, and ‘what kind of a young
lady was it, who was going to take Watty Scott?’ The
poet soon after found means to conciliate Lord Downshire
to his views in reference to Miss Carpenter, and
the marriage took place at Carlisle within four months
of the first acquaintance of the parties. The match,
made up under such extraordinary circumstances, was a
happy one; a kind and gentle nature resided in the
bosoms of both parties, and they lived accordingly in
the utmost peace and amity.</p>

<p>Scott now commenced house-keeping in Edinburgh,
where he had hitherto lived in the paternal mansion.
We now see him as a young married man, spending the
winter in the bosom of a frugal but elegant society in
Edinburgh, and the summer months in a retired cottage
on the beautiful banks of the Esk at Lasswade; cultivating,
as before, literary tastes, and storing his mind with
his favourite kind of learning, but not as yet conscious
of his active literary powers, or thinking of aught but
the duties of his profession and the claims of his little
family. As an advocate, he had perhaps some little
employment at the provincial sittings of the criminal
court, and occasionally acted in unimportant causes as
a junior counsel; but he neither obtained, nor seemed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">41</span>
qualified to obtain, a sufficient share of general business
to insure an independence. The truth is, his
mind was not yet emancipated from that enthusiastic
pursuit of knowledge which had distinguished
his youth. His necessities, with only himself to provide
for, and a sure retreat behind him in the comfortable
circumstances of his native home, were not so
great as to make an exclusive application to his profession
imperative; and he therefore seemed destined
to join what a sarcastic barrister has termed ‘the ranks
of the gentlemen who are not anxious for business.’
Although he could speak readily and fluently at the bar,
his intellect was not at all of a forensic cast. He
appeared to be too much of the abstract and unworldly
scholar, to assume readily the habits of an adroit
pleader; and even although he had been perfectly
competent to the duties, it is a question if his external
aspect and general reputation would have permitted the
generality of agents to intrust them to his hands.
Nevertheless, on more than one occasion, he made a
considerable impression on his hearers. Once, in
particular, when acting as counsel for a culprit before
the High Court of Justiciary, he exerted such powers of
persuasive oratory as excited the admiration of the
court. It happened that there was some informality in
the verdict of the jury, which at that time was always
given in writing. This afforded a still more favourable
opportunity for displaying his rhetorical powers than
what had occurred in the course of the trial, and the
sensation which he produced was long remembered by
those who witnessed it. The panel, as the accused
person is termed in Scotland, was acquitted.</p>

<p>Simple and manly in habits, good-humoured, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">42</span>
averse to disputation, full of delightful information,
kind and obliging to all who came near him, yet
possessed of a rectitude and solidity of understanding
which never allowed him to be the fool of any of his
feelings, it is no wonder that Walter Scott was a general
favourite, or that he attracted the regard of several
persons of rank, as the Duke of Buccleuch, Lord
Melville, and others. It was through the kindness of
the first of these noblemen that, in 1799, he obtained
the appointment of sheriff of Selkirkshire, an office of
light duty, with a salary of £300 per annum. In the
same year, Scott lost his father, who died in his 70th
year, after a long period of suffering.</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="toclink_42">POEMS.</h2>
</div>

<p>It was not Scott’s destiny to attain distinction as a
lawyer. While never neglecting his professional duties,
his mind had its main bent towards literature. Having
learned German, he translated and published a version
of Goethe’s <i xml:lang="de" lang="de">Goetz von Berlichingen</i>, a drama of such a
romantic cast as harmonised entirely with his peculiar
taste. He also was induced, by Mr M. G. Lewis, the
well-known author of <i>The Monk</i>, to write two or three
ballads on supernatural themes for a collection which
was to be entitled <i>Tales of Wonder</i>. <i>Goetz</i> appeared in
February 1799, but met the fate of the former publication.
When the <i>Tales of Wonder</i> came out, Scott’s
ballads, though unfortunate in their association, obtained
some praise, yet, on the whole, might also be considered
as a failure. These would have been disappointments
to a man who had set his heart on literary reputation.
To Scott, who was at all periods of his career<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">43</span>
humble-minded about his literary efforts, they were
nothing of the kind. In this respect, he was a pattern
to all authors, present and to come.</p>

<p>The circumstances seem to have been almost accidental
which led him to make his first serious adventure
in the literary world. His schoolfellow, James Ballantyne,
was now settled at Kelso in the management of a
weekly newspaper. Merely to give employment to his
friend’s types during the intervals of their ordinary use,
Scott proposed to print a small collection of the old
ballads which for some years he had been collecting on
the Border. When the design was formed, he set about
preparing the work, for which he soon obtained some
assistance from Richard Heber and John Leyden—the
former an Englishman of fortune, and an enthusiastic
collector of books; the latter a Scottish peasant’s son,
who had studied for the church, and become a marvel
of learning, especially in languages and antiquities.
The <i>Minstrelsy of the Scottish Border</i> thus grew upon his
hands, until it became such an assemblage of ballads,
ancient and modern, and of historical annotation, as
could only be contained in three octavo volumes. The
first two made their appearance in January 1802, and
met a favourable reception. Many of the ballads were
entirely new to the world; even those which had been
published before, here appeared in superior versions.
Industry in the collection of copies, and taste in the
selection of readings, had enabled the editor to present
this branch of popular literature with attractions it never
possessed before; while the graceful and intelligent
prose interspersed throughout, rich with curious learning,
and enlivened by many a pleasant traditionary anecdote,
served to constitute the whole as a most agreeable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">44</span>
mélange. The work gave Scott at once a respectable
place in the literary republic, more indeed as an editor
than as an author, though one would suppose few could
be altogether insensible to the spirit and graphic power
displayed in the ballads of his own composition.</p>

<p>The public generally, and the booksellers in particular,
were agreeably surprised to find the <i>Minstrelsy</i>, while
bearing the unwonted imprint of ‘Kelso,’ a marvel of
beautiful typography; a circumstance owing to the good
taste of James Ballantyne, and which was of some avail
in increasing the popularity of the work. It appears
that Scott, besides some gains from the first edition,
obtained soon after £500 for the copyright.</p>

<p>About this time he inherited between five and six
thousand pounds from a paternal uncle. This, with his
share of his deceased father’s property, his sheriffship,
and his wife’s allowance from her brother, now advancing
to fortune in India, made his income altogether about a
thousand a year. He had been ten years at the bar
with little success; his gains seldom reaching two
hundred a year, and these from the merest drudgeries of
the profession. It began, therefore, to appear to him
that, in as far as any further income might be required
to support his station in life, and advance the prospects
of his children, it would be well to look for it rather to
some post in the Court of Session, such as one of the
principal clerkships, than to practice as a barrister.
Assured in the meantime against want, and trusting to
such a prospect being realisable by his friends the
Buccleuchs and Melvilles, he gradually became disposed
to give more of his regards to literature. As to income
from this source, he had little hope or faith. Literary
research and composition were as yet their own reward<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">45</span>
with him; if any more solid remuneration accrued, he
was happy to receive it; but he would not depend on
such gains. Let literature, he said, be at the utmost a
staff—not a crutch. It was natural for a prudent man
of the world to form these ideas at that time, when
literary biography was little besides a record of privation
and sorrow. But it would have, nevertheless, been well
for Scott if he had been content with his secured income,
and the prospect of only such contingent additions to
it as a fixed post or the profits of literature might hold
out. To his over-anxious mind, when the temptation
came, it appeared different, as we shall presently see.</p>

<p>It was about the time when the <i>Minstrelsy</i> was
issuing from the press, that Scott was asked by the
lovely and amiable Countess of Dalkeith to write a
ballad upon a traditionary goblin story respecting the
Buccleuch family. He commenced such a composition
accordingly, adopting for its measure that of a recent
poem of Coleridge; but it grew upon his hands far
beyond ballad size. It became, in short, a long
romantic narrative, divided into cantos, and <em>set</em> in a
subordinate narrative, wherein the author represented it
as a recitation by the last survivor of the fraternity of
minstrels. This was published in January 1805, as <i>The
Lay of the Last Minstrel</i>, and at once placed Scott in
the first rank as an original poet, besides determining
his fate as henceforth chiefly that of a man of letters.
Immediately on the first edition proving successful, the
publishers gave £600 for the copyright.</p>

<p>Before this time, Mr Ballantyne had set up a printing-office
in Edinburgh, partly by the assistance of a loan
from his old friend. Getting rapidly into a considerable
business, which his skill and taste amply justified, he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">46</span>
came to require additional capital, and Scott at length
agreed to advance the needful sum, on condition of his
being made a partner, but a secret one, in the concern.
His dread of dependence on literary gains seems to
have blinded him to the fact, that mercantile gains are
also precarious, and usually attended by risks.</p>

<p>By the interest of his titled friends, he soon after
obtained an appointment to the duties of a clerkship in
the Court of Session; the salary, however, which afterwards
was fixed at £1300 a year, was not to be realised
till the death of a superannuated predecessor in office,
and, in fact, Scott touched nothing of it till 1812. With
such an addition to his solid prospects, one cannot but
wonder at the eagerness and assiduity with which he
commenced and pursued literary labours of a severely
tasking kind; such as an edition of the works of Dryden,
a publication of Sadler’s State Papers, and a reprint of
Somers’s collection of Tracts. It seems as if a naturally
ambitious and ardent spirit had at length found a vent
for its energies, and felt a self-rewarding pleasure in
their exercise. At the same time, he gave much of his
time to volunteer soldiering, to politics, and to the
affairs of literary men less fortunate than himself. The
recollections of his friends present a charming picture of
his ordinary life at his summer retreat of Ashestiel on
the Tweed, where he had found it necessary to establish
himself on account of his duties as sheriff of Selkirkshire.
His household, enlivened by four healthy children, and
superintended by Mrs Scott, was marked by simple
elegance. On Sundays, being far from church, he read
prayers and a sermon to his family; then, if the weather
was good, he would walk with them, servants and all, to
some favourite spot at a convenient distance, and dine<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">47</span>
with them in the open air. Frequent excursions on
horseback, and coursing-matches, varied the tenor of
common domestic life. Friends coming to pay visits
found him in constant good-humour, and at all times
willing to introduce them to the fine scenery and
interesting antiquities of the district. In the evenings,
his conversation, in which stories and anecdotes formed
a large part, was a sure resource against ennui. As a
husband and father, he was most kind and indulgent.
His children had access to his room at all times; and
when they came—unconscious of the nature of his
studies—and asked for a story, he would take them on
his knee, repeat a tale or a ballad, kiss them, and then
set them down again to their sports, never apparently
feeling the least annoyance at the interruption. His
dogs, of which he always had two or three, were even
more privileged, for he kept his window open in nearly
all weathers, that they might leap out and in as they
pleased.</p>

<p>These were the happiest days of Scott’s life, when
as yet in the enjoyment of full vigour of body and
mind, rather acquiring than reposing upon fame, and
unembarrassed by possessions and dignities which afterwards
made his position false and dangerous. He
occasionally visited London, and allowed himself to go
through that kind of exhibition called <em>lionising</em>, to which
everything famous, or even notorious, is liable to be
subjected in the metropolis; but he never was in the
slightest degree spoiled by such idolatry. He fully
shewed that he estimated it at its real worth, and, after
good-naturedly submitting to it, could laugh at its
absurdity. It is less pleasant to record a change in his
arrangements for study which took place about this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">48</span>
time. Finding the day apt to be broken in upon by
little duties and by visitors, he adopted the habit of
rising and commencing his literary toils at six in the
morning, usually finishing them at twelve, after the
interruption of breakfast at ten. His biographer, Mr
Lockhart, tells us how careful he was to dress neatly
before sitting down, but he says nothing of his preparing
for the duty before him by taking food. We have come
to understand such things better now, and can easily see
what fatal effects might arise in a few years from a
habit of performing the principal duties of life with an
exhausted system.</p>

<p>The year 1808 saw his poetical reputation brought to
its zenith by the publication of the admirable romantic
tale of <i>Marmion</i>, for which, to the astonishment of the
public, Mr Constable undertook beforehand to pay a
thousand guineas. Not long after, his zeal in Tory
politics, or, as he thought it, solicitude for the honour
and safety of his country, then harassed by the Bonaparte
wars, led to his quarrelling with this eminent
publisher, and to his taking an interest in the establishment
of the <i>Quarterly</i>, as an opposition to the <i>Edinburgh
Review</i>. It would have been well if he had stopped here;
but the same feelings, helped, perhaps, by that trafficking
spirit which had entered into him since he lost
hopes at the bar, induced the false step of his setting up
a publishing-house in Edinburgh, under the <em>firm</em> of John
Ballantyne and Company, the ostensible manager being
a younger brother of the printer, a clever comical being,
not overstocked with worldly prudence, and possessed
of few qualifications for business beyond a knowledge of
accounts.</p>

<p>From this house issued, in May 1810, his most<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">49</span>
pleasing poem, the <i>Lady of the Lake</i>, which experienced
even greater popularity than either of its two predecessors,
and might, if anything could, have made its
author a vain man. In this and his two preceding
poems, the chief charm lay in the vividness with which
the author brought the past before the minds of his
readers. He gave the grace, the dignity, the gallantry
of old times, free from all their rudeness and grossness.
All was done, too, in such an easy and fluent style, that
the reader was never wearied. The singular fascination
of these writings shewed itself in numberless ways; for
one thing, there was a rush of tourists to the scene of
the <i>Lady of the Lake</i>, so great, as to produce a marked
rise of the amount of post-horse duty raised in Scotland.
Scott’s own firm, in connection with another, undertook
to pay two thousand guineas for the <i>Lady of the Lake</i>,
a fact in authorship at that time without anything
approaching to a parallel. Meanwhile, he was urging
into print, as a publisher, an <i>Annual Register</i> (to commence
with the year 1808); an edition of Beaumont
and Fletcher, under the care of a drudging German of
the name of Weber; a huge quarto, under the title of
<i>Tixall Poetry</i>; an edition of Defoe’s novels; the <i>Secret
Memoirs of the Court of James I.</i>; and some other books
agreeable to his own taste, but hardly to that of the
public.</p>

<p>These huge indigestible masses of paper and print
had brought his outlay in the printing and publishing
concerns up to £9000 before the end of this
year. Scarcely ever did the most thoughtless of the
tuneful tribe make a more unfortunate adventure than
this publishing affair was destined to prove itself. If
Scott had instituted some safe and modest copartnery,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">50</span>
to give himself the publishing profits of his own writings,
diminished only by expenses and the small profits due
to his acting associates, he would have been doing what
perhaps it will yet be seen all authors of decided popularity
may rightly do. But he had an antiquarian taste,
and a disposition to over-estimate all literary productions
save his own—he indulged these tendencies in his
firm of John Ballantyne and Company, and unavoidably
became a great loser. Before it was fully seen that such
was to be his fate as a man of business—namely, in the
summer of 1811—he had thought so well of his means
and prospects—the clerkship salary being now on the
eve of realisation—as to resolve on purchasing a hundred
acres of land on Tweedside, in order to build a cottage
residence for himself, and this notwithstanding that the
£4000 requisite in the very first place had to be
borrowed, the one half as a permanent burden on the
property. Such was the origin of his estate of Abbotsford,
where ultimately he reared a castle. The purchase
would have been perfectly a right one, if he had not
involved his superfluous fortune in business: as things
actually stood, it was only preparing for himself needless
embarrassments.</p>

<p>His removal to the little estate which he had purchased
took place in May 1812, and he soon became
involved in the pleasant but costly labours attendant on
building, planting, and what is called <em>making a place</em>.
At the same time, besides attending to other literary
avocations, he was composing a fourth romance in verse,
which appeared just before the close of the year under
the title of <i>Rokeby</i>, but in point of popularity proved a
comparative failure. Ere this time, the concerns of John
Ballantyne and Company were seriously embarrassed,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">51</span>
insomuch that Scott was glad to accept of a little
credit from his friend Mr Morritt of Rokeby Park.
The difficulties had only increased during the early
months of 1813, and it then became necessary for those
who had begun in rivalry to Mr Constable, to resort to
that publisher for his friendly aid. To give an idea of
the fatality of the whole adventure, it appears that the
single publication of <i>Tixall Poetry</i>, which proved a dead
failure, involved an outlay of £2500, while the <i>Edinburgh
Annual Register</i> was attended by an annual loss
of £1000. At the same time, all the parties concerned
were living in a style rather suited to their hopes than
to their realised profits. To sustain so severe a drainage,
the private fortune of Scott, and even his unprecedented
literary gains, were inadequate. Fortunately, the hope
of regaining the author of <i>Marmion</i> as an adherent of
his house, induced Mr Constable to grant relief to some
extent by the purchase of stock, trusting that the rival
house would as soon as possible be extinguished. The
Duke of Buccleuch also extended the favour of his
credit for the sum of £4000, by means of which, and
of further sales of stock to other publishers, the principal
difficulties were passed, though not without the
most serious vexation to Scott for the greater part of a
year. In the midst of his worst perplexities, he resigned
an offer of the laureateship to Mr Southey, and was
liberal as usual to unfortunate men of letters, sending,
for one thing, fifty pounds to Mr Maturin, the Irish
novelist.</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="toclink_51">WAVERLEY NOVELS.</h2>
</div>

<p>Scott had, so early as 1805, commenced a prose
fiction on the manners of the Highlanders, which he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">52</span>
designated <i>Waverley, or, ’Tis Sixty Years Since</i>. Discouraged
by the unfavourable opinion of his friends
regarding the first few chapters, he threw aside the
manuscript, which lay accordingly unthought of in an
old desk for nine years. Happening to find it while
rummaging for fishing-tackle, he bethought him of
completing the story, and seriously trying his fortune
in a new walk of literature. Three weeks of June 1814
enabled him to add the second and third volumes, and
the tale appeared anonymously in the ensuing month.
The public almost immediately appreciated its merits,
and the first edition of a thousand copies meeting with
a quick sale, was speedily followed by a second and a
third. The lifelike representation here given of times
not too remote for sympathy, and yet sufficiently so in
character to tell as eminently romantic, joined to the
wonderful ease, spirit, and mingled humour and pathos
of the narrative, gave <i>Waverley</i> at once a place far
above all contemporary novels, and awakened great
curiosity regarding the unknown author.</p>

<p>Always unconcerned about the fate of his works, Scott
immediately set out on a six weeks’ yachting excursion
round the north of Scotland, with hardly a chance of
hearing news from the world of letters during that time.
The excursion was performed in company with the
Commissioners of Northern Light-houses, of whom
he was the guest. As yet, the Commissioners had no
steam-vessel for their annual trips, but used a sailing
yacht, provided with arms for defence, in case of attack,
against French privateers or other marauders. Sailing
from Leith on the 29th July 1814, the party first
visited the Isle of May, and thence proceeded northward.
In passing, they landed on the Bell Rock, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">53</span>
inspected the recently erected light-house on that
dangerous reef. In the album of the keepers, it is
customary for visitors to inscribe their name, along with
any passing remark. Sir Walter inscribed the following
impromptu lines:</p>

<p class="phead">
‘<span class="smcap">Pharos Loquitur.</span>
</p>

<div class="poetry-container w18">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Far on the bosom of the deep,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">O’er these wild shelves my watch I keep;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A ruddy gem of changeful light,</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">The seaman bids my lustre hail,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And scorns to strike his timorous sail.’</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="in0">It was in this northern maritime excursion that Sir
Walter visited Shetland, and stored his mind with those
materials which afterwards were so charmingly developed
in the romance of the <i>Pirate</i>.</p>

<p>The secrecy which was maintained regarding the
authorship of <i>Waverley</i> and the succeeding novels,
helped to give them a certain piquancy, independently
of their intrinsic merits. At the same time, many
reflecting persons were at no loss to see that only
the same mind which had reproduced the times of the
Jameses in <i>Marmion</i> and the <i>Lady of the Lake</i>, could
have resuscitated the court and camp of the Chevalier
in 1745; but with the mass of the public the mystery
was successful. Some thought it most likely that
Scott’s brother, Thomas, had produced this romance;
there were even some who attributed it to Mr Jeffrey.
Of Thomas he had himself so high an opinion, that
he about this time offered him money from his
own pocket for any novel he might produce. But
the opinion of Walter Scott regarding the literary
powers of his contemporaries was of absolutely not the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">54</span>
least value, in consequence of the peculiar generosity
of his nature. Thomas Scott and many others whom he
stimulated, and helped to become authors, were in the
eyes of the world very ordinary persons, and can only
be remembered because they were the objects of this
great man’s love and esteem.</p>

<p>The success of <i>Waverley</i>, and the necessity of money
to relieve the Ballantyne concern, quickly urged Scott
to a new effort in the same walk. During the short
vacation at the Christmas of this year (1814), he produced
his tale of <i>Guy Mannering</i>, which, being published
in the ensuing February, was received with transports
of delight (more sober language would be quite inappropriate)
by both the Scottish and English public. The
author had, only a month before, brought out his last
great poem, <i>The Lord of the Isles</i>, which met with a
reception so cool as to convince him that he must now
resign the top of the poetical walk to his young rival,
Lord Byron. He heard the report of the public
decision on this point from James Ballantyne, was disconcerted
for a few minutes, and then, recovering his
usual spirits, tranquilly resumed the writing of his novel.
How much it would tell to the happiness of literary men
in general, if they had but a tithe of the equanimity
of Scott about the success of their exertions! In the
summer of this memorable year he visited the field of
Waterloo, and wrote on that subject a descriptive work,
entitled <i>Paul’s Letters to his Kinsfolk</i>, and also a poem,
which proved a failure in respect of popular approbation.
The results of these various labours, with his professional
income, not only set him free of the immediate pressure
of the publishing encumbrances, but enabled him to
add somewhat to his domains on Tweedside. This<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">55</span>
year was also memorable to him as that which introduced
him to the personal notice of the Prince Regent,
who, after greatly enjoying his society at Carlton House,
sent him a present of a gold snuff-box set in brilliants.</p>

<p>Scott was now at ease in his circumstances. He had
a pleasant house in Edinburgh, No. 39 Castle Street—‘dear
39,’ as he affectionately called it—where he enjoyed
the best society in the Scottish capital. Then, for recreation,
he had that fanciful but costly domain on the Tweed.
His ordinary and assured income sufficed for any domestic
expenditure he chose to indulge in; the recent embarrassments
were at an end; and he might calculate on
easily adding a few occasional thousands, for the sake
of posterity, by no very great exertion of his ever-fertile
brain. But who of mortal mould can ever say ‘enough,’
especially when the temptation of great facility in
acquiring is before him. For Scott at this time to grow
from the idea of a cottage retreat in the country, to that
of a little lairdship and a good sort of mansion, was
certainly very natural, when he found that the work of
little more than a month at any time could secure him
enough of money to buy from fifty to a hundred acres
of ground. It was the more so in his case, as his
education, and the original bent of his own feelings,
alike tended to create in him a veneration for the
possession of land. Add to this, that he had a taste
for planting and decoration, and felt a genial joy in
being bread-giver to a retinue of that kindly peasantry
whose virtues he has himself depicted in such lively
colours. Of vulgar ambition for wealth and state, there
was in Scott not one particle: to be a chief of the soil
and its people, and contemplate his children as succeeding
him in the same character, was only, with him, to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">56</span>
realise, or set forth in substance, one of the poetical
dreams which haunted his mind. It is therefore not
surprising at this period to find him far from being disposed
to suspend his energies, even although he might
have done so under the excuse of somewhat broken
health, for he now had frequent visits of stomach-cramp—in
no small degree a consequence of some of his
literary habits.</p>

<p>The spring of 1816 saw the public in possession of
his novel of <i>The Antiquary</i>, perhaps, of all his works,
the one in which there is most of the current matter of
his own mind. It was scarcely published before he had
designed his <i>Tales of My Landlord</i>, the first series of
which came out, as by a new author, in December, and
was at once hailed with all the applause accorded to its
predecessors, and set down as another offshoot of the
same tree. Early in 1817 appeared <i>Harold the Dauntless</i>,
which, not bearing his name, and being even a greater
failure than any of his recent poems, formed the last of
that class of his publications. The public might now,
perhaps, have had a more rapid succession of novels
from his pen, if he had not thought proper to write the
historical part of his <i>Annual Register</i>, in a vain hope to
float that unfortunate work into popularity. As it was,
he produced this year his novel of <i>Rob Roy</i>, which came
out at New Year 1818, and experienced a brilliant
reception. So great was his sense of the encouragement
extended to these novels, that in 1817 he made
purchase of an addition to his property, involving an
outlay of no less than £10,000. Just to shew, however,
how much generosity towards others was mixed with the
no way mean ambition of Scott, his prime object here
was to secure a residence for his old school-friend,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">57</span>
Adam Ferguson, and his sisters, whom he was eager to
plant near his own fireside. On his concluding a rather
hasty bargain for this estate, Ferguson expressed his
surprise and concern at seeing him exert so little pains
to cheapen it. ‘Never say a word about it,’ said Scott;
‘it will just answer you and the ladies exactly; and it’s
only scribbling a little more nonsense some of these
mornings, to pay anything it costs me more than
enough.’ From calculations of this kind, Scott is
understood to have bought nearly the whole of his
landed property at a very large percentage above its
actual value.</p>

<p>From this time till the close of 1825—a space of eight
years—prosperity reigned unchecked over the life of
Scott. His novels of <i>The Heart of Mid-Lothian</i>, <i>The
Bride of Lammermoor</i>, <i>The Legend of Montrose</i>, <i>Ivanhoe</i>,
<i>The Monastery</i>, <i>The Abbot</i>, <i>The Pirate</i>, <i>Kenilworth</i>, <i>The
Fortunes of Nigel</i>, <i>Peveril of the Peak</i>, <i>Quentin Durward</i>,
<i>St Ronan’s Well</i>, <i>Redgauntlet</i>, and the <i>Tales of the
Crusaders</i>, streamed from his pen with a rapidity as
wonderful as their general merits were great. The
public read with delight, and Scott was happy to pipe
to a dance which led to such solid results for his own
benefit. Generally, the first burst of sale called for ten
thousand copies, after which the books continued to go
off in large numbers in handsome collective reprints.
It is odd after all, since Scott had shewed a desire to
increase his gains by being his own printer and publisher,
that he gave these books to be published by Constable,
or whatever other person, on the principle of a division
of the profits—a plan far too favourable to the tradesman,
considering that the works were sure to sell with
little aid from that quarter. A more grasping author<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">58</span>
would have given them to be published on commission,
and thus realised the whole profit excepting a fraction.
The only deduction he made from this liberality to the
actual publisher consisted in its being a point with him
that the Ballantynes should have a share of that portion
of the profits—a mere grace on his part towards men for
whom he entertained a friendship. In 1819, Messrs
Constable and Company agreed to give him, for the
copyright of the novels published up to that time,
and certain shares of poetical copyrights, the sum of
£12,000. Two years later, the same booksellers
purchased for £5000 the copyright of four succeeding
novels—little more than a year’s work—from which the
author had already drawn £10,000. After another
similar interval, the author received five thousand
guineas for other four novels, which likewise had
previously yielded him half-profits. Scott spoke of
these sums with triumph and pleasure, as wonderful
prices for what he was pleased to call his <em>yeld kye</em>—that
is, cows which have ceased to give milk. Such a result
of successful authorship was a surprising novelty in
its day. Nor was the author alone blessed by the
pecuniary productiveness of the Waverley Novels. We
find the Edinburgh theatrical manager realising £3000
by the brilliant run of the drama formed from <i>Rob Roy</i>.
A painter gets £300 for sketches to illustrate a section
of the tales.</p>

<p>If we reflect on the facility with which Scott could
write these inimitable novels—devoting to them merely
the mornings of a life full of other business and of
amusement—we can hardly be surprised to learn that
he thought nothing of entering into engagements with
Constable and Company for producing four novels, not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">59</span>
one line of which had then been written, nor even the
leading theme determined on. Nor was it wonderful
that he should have gradually been tempted to build
additions to his house on Tweedside till it became the
architectural romance which it now is, and fitted to
receive and entertain a large assortment of company.</p>

<p>The house of Abbotsford, where Sir Walter Scott
chiefly spent the last twenty years of his life, may be
assumed as the centre of a great part of that region
which we have styled <em>his</em>. This ‘romance in stone and
lime,’ as some Frenchman termed it, is situated on the
south bank of the Tweed, at that part of its course
where the river bursts forth from the mountainous region
of the forest into the more open country of Roxburghshire,
two or three miles above the abbey of Melrose,
and six-and-thirty from Edinburgh. Though upon a
small scale, the Gothic battlements and turrets have a
good effect, and would have a still better, if the site of
the house were not somewhat straitened by the bank
rising above it, and by the too close neighbourhood of
the public road. Descriptions of the house, with its
armoury, its library, its curiosities, and other particular
features, have been given in so many different publications,
that no repetition here is necessary. The
house, if it be properly preserved, will certainly be
perused by future generations as only a different kind of
emanation of the genius of this wonderful man; though,
preserve it as you will, it will probably be, of all his
works, the soonest to perish.</p>

<p>All around Abbotsford, and what gave it a great part
of its value in his eyes, are the scenes commemorated in
Border history, and tradition, and song. The property
itself comprises the spot on which the last feudal battle<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">60</span>
was fought in this part of the country. The abbeys of
Melrose and Dryburgh, the latter of which now contains
the revered dust of the minstrel; the Eildon Hills,
renowned in the annals of superstition; Selkirk, whose
brave burghers won glory in the field where so much
was lost by others, namely, at Flodden; Ettrick Forest,
with its lone and storied dales; and Yarrow, whose
stream and ‘dowie dens’ are not to be surveyed without
involuntary poetry—are all in the near neighbourhood
of the spot. The love, the deep, heartfelt love which
Scott bore to the land which contains these places, was
such as no stranger can appreciate. It was a passion
absorbing many others which might have been expected
to hold sway over him, and it survived to the last.</p>

<p>Scott was social and good-natured; to see him and his
mansion was an object of ambition to half the public,
including the highest persons in the land. He was thus
led, during the seven months of the year which he
spent in the country, to be the host of so many persons
of every kind, that his wife spoke of the house as a
hotel in all but the name. Not that he would have
voluntarily indulged in any undue expense on this
account, if he had been in limited circumstances; but
believing himself to be able to afford it, benevolence
gave her irresistible dictate that he should thus make
himself the servant of the public, even at the expense
of much personal inconvenience to himself and his
family. It is stated in Mr Lockhart’s biography that
sixteen uninvited parties came in one day to Abbotsford.
These would pass quickly away; but fashionable tourists,
some of them of high rank, came in scarcely smaller
shoals, to stay one or two days. A lady reports to us,
from the conversation of Miss Anne Scott, the younger<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">61</span>
daughter of Sir Walter, that on one occasion there were
<em>thirteen ladies’-maids</em> in the house.</p>

<p>In 1820, Scott was made a baronet. The honour
was unsolicited, and he considered himself as accepting
it, partly because it was gratifying to his family, and
partly with a view to the interests of his eldest son, who
had entered a hussar regiment. If he had any enjoyment
of the honour in his own breast, it probably arose
from no common worldly vanity, but from its touching
on some string of romantic feeling amongst those to
which we owe his delightful works. Though now a
<em>laird</em> and a man of title, as well as the head idol in the
temple of the intellect-worshippers of his time, he was
no whit different from what he had been in his younger
days, when content with love and a cottage at Lasswade.
His personal tastes and habits, his bearing to his
friends, his familiarity with the poor and lowly, remained
the same. As Wilkes is said to have never been a
Wilkite, so Scott never, to any appearance, joined the
opinion which the world entertained about him as an
author. He spoke of his labours in this manner to
Southey: ‘Dallying with time—tossing my ball and
driving my hoop.’ Such men as Davy and Watt he
considered as the true honour of his age and country.
At home, in the bosom of his family, when the world
would let him alone, he was the most simple and kindly
of associates. As he walked about his grounds, he
conversed freely and easily with his servants and the
peasantry, amongst whom he was an object of the
deepest reverence and affection. Often would this
illustrious man work half a day at the felling of trees
in his woods, beside several workmen, trying which
could cut down one with the fewest blows, and laughing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">62</span>
heartily when he was victor. He delighted to walk in
the evening towards the house of an aged servant, that
he might hear the psalm which the old man was raising
with his wife, as they conducted their evening devotions.
One of his retinue said to a visitor one day: ‘Sir Walter
speaks to every man as if they were blood-relations.’
It was not a condescending kind of talk he indulged in
with these people. He entered into their feelings and
tastes, and, speaking their own homely dialect, witched
them out of the idea that a master or a laird was before
them.</p>

<p>The year 1822 was a somewhat memorable one in
Scott’s life, on account of the concern he had to take
in the arrangements necessary on the occasion of the
king’s visit to Scotland. The external character of this
piece of pageantry was much determined by that revival
of national and medieval associations which the novels
had effected. Everywhere we were reminded of the
Stuarts in Holyrood, and the plaided clansmen on their
mountains. Feelings due towards the romantic kings
of an elder day were expended, often ludicrously, on
the battered beau of Carlton House and St James’s
Street. Amidst the delirium of the time, the man chiefly
concerned in giving it a peculiar character, moved in
perfect possession of his wonderful powers of management,
dictating or advising in the principal doings, and
attending to the minutest details of many of them. The
king afterwards expressed, both formally and in private,
his deep sense of obligation to Scott for what he had
done to make this visit pass off well. The affair is
interesting for the proof it gives of the business genius
of Scott, and his qualifications for the affairs of the
world. Assuredly never was high imagination united<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">63</span>
with so many of the soberest mental qualities as in his
instance.</p>

<p>His qualifications as a man of the world shone in
various functions which he consented to assume about
this time, as the presidency of the Royal Society of
Edinburgh, that of an antiquarian book-printing association
called the Bannatyne Club, the chairmanship of an
oil-gas factory, and so forth. He had no inclination to
thrust himself into such situations, but having been
drawn into them, he set about the business which they
involved with all the requisite zeal, and with a marvellous
amount of skill, good temper, and judgment.
The common-sense and sagacity which he exhibited
in the performance of these duties, form, perhaps, a
greater distinction between Scott and the generality of
literary men than even his transcendent genius.</p>

<p>Sir Walter, as has been stated, had strong Conservative
leanings, in which respect he sometimes unfortunately
went beyond the dictates of prudence. In 1820, he
endeavoured to prove the absurdity of the popular
excitement in favour of a more extended kind of
parliamentary representation, by three papers which he
inserted in the <i>Edinburgh Weekly Journal</i> newspaper,
under the title of ‘The Visionary.’ However well
intended, these were not by any means happy specimens
of political disquisition. The truth is, Sir Walter, with
all his high literary gifts, did not possess the art of concocting
a short essay, either on politics or on any moral
or general topic. He appears, moreover, to have been
in a great measure ignorant of the arguments and
strength of his political opponents. He treats them as
if they were in the mass a set of simple and uninformed
people, led away by a few raving demagogues; and his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">64</span>
attempt, accordingly, appears nearly as ridiculous as it
might be to address grown men with the arguments
which prevail only with children. Some months afterwards,
it was deemed necessary by a few of the Tory
gentlemen and lawyers, to establish a newspaper in
which the more violent of the radical prints should be
met upon their own grounds, and reprisals made for a
long course of insults which had hitherto been endured
with patience. To this association Sir Walter subscribed,
and, by means partly furnished upon his credit, a weekly
journal was commenced under the title of <i>The Beacon</i>.
As the scurrilities of this print inflicted much pain in
very respectable quarters, and finally led to the death of
one of the writers in a duel, it sunk, after an existence
of a few months, amidst the general execrations of the
community. Sir Walter Scott, though he probably never
contemplated, and perhaps was hardly aware of the guilt
of <i>The Beacon</i>, was loudly blamed for his connection
with it. It must be allowed, in extenuation of his
offence, that the whole affair was only an experiment, to
try the effect of violent argument on the Tory side, and
that, if it did not exceed the warmth of the radical
prints, there was nothing abstractly unfair in the attempt.
On the other hand, a party who stand in the light of
governors, and who, in general, are placed in comfortable
circumstances, assume violence with a much worse
grace than the multitudinous plebeians, who are confessedly
in a situation from which complaint and irritation
are almost inseparable.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="toclink_64">[SIR WALTER AND MR R. CHAMBERS.</h2>
</div>

<p>In his preface to the new edition of the <i>Traditions of
Edinburgh</i> (1869), Mr R. Chambers gives the following<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">65</span>
account of the manner in which he became acquainted
with Scott. ‘When not out of my teens, I attracted some
attention from Sir Walter Scott, by writing for him and
presenting him (through Mr Constable) a transcript of
the songs of the <i>Lady of the Lake</i>, in a style of peculiar
caligraphy’ [resembling small print], ‘which I practised
for want of any way of attracting the notice of people
superior to myself. When George IV., some months
afterwards, came to Edinburgh’ [August 1822], ‘good
Sir Walter remembered me, and procured for me the
business of writing the address of the Royal Society of
Edinburgh to His Majesty, for which I was handsomely
paid. Several other learned bodies followed the
example, for Sir Walter was the arbiter of everything
during that frantic time, and thus I was substantially
benefited by his means.</p>

<p>‘According to what Mr Constable told me, the great
man liked me, in part, because he understood I was
from Tweedside. On seeing the earlier numbers of the
<i>Traditions</i>’ [1823] ‘he expressed astonishment as to
“where a boy got all the information.” But I did not
see or hear from him till the first volume had been
completed. He then called upon me one day, along
with Mr Lockhart. I was overwhelmed with the honour,
for Sir Walter was almost an object of worship to me.
I literally could not utter a word. While I stood silent,
I heard him tell his companion that Charles Sharpe was
a writer in the <i>Traditions</i>. A few days after this visit,
Sir Walter sent me, along with a kind letter, a packet of
manuscript, consisting of sixteen folio pages, in his usual
close hand-writing, and containing all the reminiscences
he could at that time summon up of old persons and
things in Edinburgh. Such a treasure to me! And<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">66</span>
such a gift from the greatest literary man of the age to
the humblest! Is there a literary man of the present age
who would scribble as much for any humble aspirant?
Nor was this the only act of liberality of Scott to me.
When I was preparing a subsequent work, <i>The Popular
Rhymes of Scotland</i>, he sent me whole sheets of his recollections,
with appropriate explanations. For years thereafter,
he allowed me to join him in his walks home from
the Parliament House, in the course of which he freely
poured into my greedy ears anything he knew regarding
the subjects of my studies. His kindness and good-humour
on these occasions were untiring. I have since
found, from his journal, that I had met him on certain
days when his heart was overladen with woe. Yet, his
welcome to me was the same. After 1826, however, I
saw him much less frequently than before, for I knew he
grudged every moment not spent in thinking and working
on the fatal tasks he had assigned to himself for the
redemption of his debts.’</p>

<p>It was in one of their walks through the Old Town
that Scott pointed out the place of his birth to my
brother; also the little old school in Hamilton’s Entry,
where he had received some of his rudimentary instruction.
On another occasion, he shewed him the house
once occupied by Dr Daniel Rutherford at the foot of
Hyndford’s Close, where he had often been when a boy.
It is a fine antique edifice, reputed to have been the
residence of the Earl of Selkirk in 1742. Latterly, it
has undergone some changes, with a new entrance from
the Mint Close, and forms the residence of a Roman
Catholic clergyman, in connection with a neighbouring
chapel. Sir Walter communicated to Robert a curious
circumstance connected with this old mansion. ‘It<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">67</span>
appears that the house immediately adjacent was not
furnished with a stair wide enough to allow a coffin
being carried down in decent fashion. It had, therefore,
what the Scottish law calls a <em>servitude</em> upon Dr
Rutherford’s house, conferring the perpetual liberty of
bringing the deceased inmates through a passage into
that house, and down its stair into the lane.’]</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="toclink_67">LATER NOVELS, AND LIFE OF NAPOLEON.</h2>
</div>

<p>Scott had at this time the appearance of a respectable
elderly country-gentleman. Tall, robust, and rather
handsome in person, he was deformed by the shortness
of his right limb, the foot of which only touched the
ground at the toes, while he rocked from side to side
on the support of a stout walking-cane, which he moved
along with the foot, and put down at the same time.
While living in town, he wore a common black suit; in
the country, he had gray trousers, a short green jacket,
and a white hat. The public is made familiar with his
face by numberless portraits; it is only necessary to
mention, that at this time it was ruddy with the glow of
health, and at the same time somewhat venerable from
his thin gray hair. The countenance and quick gray
eye usually had a common-world expression, but of a
benevolent kind. All was changed, however, when he
told anything serious, or recited a piece of ballad
poetry; he then seemed to become a being of a totally
different grade and sphere.</p>

<p>It has been hinted that Scott’s eldest son, Walter, had
become an officer in a hussar regiment. This youth,
in 1825, wedded a young heiress, Miss Jobson, much
to the satisfaction of his father, who, in the marriage-contract,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">68</span>
placed against the young lady’s fortune a
settlement of the estate of Abbotsford upon his son,
reserving only his own liferent. He declared that he
thus parted with the property of his lands with more
pleasure than he ever derived from the acquisition or
possession of them. He at the same time expended
£3500 in purchasing a company for his son. It was
now that the great poet might be considered as at the
height of his fortunes. His career had hitherto been
an almost uninterrupted series of prosperous and happy
events; he had risen from the briefless barrister to the
head of the literary world, a title, and the possession of
a landed fortune, with the prospect of leaving a race
of gentry to follow him. Alas! even while thus triumphantly
exalted, the ground was hollow beneath his feet,
and a sad prostration was approaching.</p>

<p>Keeping this reverse for its proper place, it is proper
here to mention that the novels had fallen off somewhat
in popularity since <i>The Monastery</i>. The author was
not made aware of this fact; but he nevertheless felt
the necessity of varying his themes as much as possible,
in order to preserve the public favour. Hence his
shifting ground to England and France, and his attempt,
in <i>St Ronan’s Well</i>, to depict the society of the modern
world. Latterly, he bethought him that history was a
field of some promise, and he was disposed to enter it.
It was now (June 1825) that Mr Constable, moved by
some examples of popular publishing in London, adopted
the idea that that trade had never been conducted on
right principles, seeing that it sought customers only in
the more affluent classes, while the masses were left to
regard books as luxuries beyond their reach. He projected
a periodical issue of volumes, at a comparatively<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">69</span>
low price, to consist of reprints of approved copyright
works belonging to his house, mingled with original
works; and claiming and obtaining the support of Scott,
it was arranged that the Waverley Novels should reappear
in this cheap form, alternated at starting with
the volumes of a <i>Life of Napoleon Bonaparte</i>, to be
composed for the purpose by the same author. Thus
was Scott set down, in 1825, to the history of one whose
career he had beheld, while it lasted, with the strongest
sentiments of reprobation and hatred, feeling, as he did,
that the French emperor was the public enemy of
England in the first place, and all Europe in the second.
It was at first intended that the work should consist of
four volumes, or less than a half of what it ultimately
became.</p>

<p>Just before going seriously into his task, he paid
a visit to his son in Ireland, where he was received
and entertained with the greatest enthusiasm by all
classes—to his own surprise, as he had regarded the
Irish as not a reading people. He had not reflected
that there is such a thing as lionising great authors on
the strength of their fame, and without any but a superficial
acquaintance, if so much, with their writings. The
contrast between the elegant mansions of the gentry in
which he lived, with the misery of the houses of the
general population, awoke painful feelings in his mind;
but, upon the whole, he much enjoyed his tour in
Ireland. In the latter part of this year, a second
domestic change took place. His eldest daughter,
Sophia, had been married in 1820 to Mr J. G. Lockhart,
a young barrister, whose talents in literature have
been fully acknowledged by the public. Hitherto, the
young couple had lived in his immediate neighbourhood,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">70</span>
both in town and country. He delighted in the ballads
which Mrs Lockhart sang to him with the accompaniment
of her harp; he found Mr Lockhart a useful
adviser in literary matters, and a most agreeable companion;
and he felt the tenderest interest in their eldest
child, called John Hugh, or, familiarly, ‘Hugh Littlejohn,’
whose fatal delicacy of constitution only heightened
the affection he was otherwise fitted to excite. In consequence
of an offer of the editorship of the <i>Quarterly
Review,</i> Mr Lockhart removed to London with his
family, by which Scott’s family circle was of course
much contracted. This, however, was but a trifling evil
compared with others which were about to befall the
hitherto fortunate author of <i>Waverley</i>.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="toclink_70">PECUNIARY MISFORTUNES.</h2>
</div>

<p>The years 1824 and 1825 were distinguished by an
extraordinary mania for speculation, the consequence of
which was, that, towards the close of the latter year, a
scarcity of money began to be generally felt. A tightening
of this kind always of course tells severely upon
men who have been keeping up their trade by means
of fictitious bills; and of this class it now appeared
were Archibald Constable and Company. The leading
member of this firm had been fortunate in the proprietorship
of the <i>Edinburgh Review,</i> and the publishing
of many of the works of Scott. Naturally grand in his
ideas, and of an aspiring temper, at the same time that
he despised, and in practice wholly overlooked, common
mercantile calculations, he had come to conduct business
in a manner which usually leads to ruin. We have
seen that the bookselling concern of Scott (John<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">71</span>
Ballantyne and Company) was indebted to him for
some important assistance in enabling it to wind up;
the printing concern (James Ballantyne and Company)
was also indebted to him for a vast amount of business;
while Scott, more personally, was so imprudent as to
take bill payments from him for works as yet unwritten,
that he might help out his equally imprudent purchases
of land. By these means, it came about very naturally
that the name of James Ballantyne and Company—that
is, Sir Walter Scott—was lent to Constable and Company
for the raising of large sums amongst the banks.
Scott, venerating the supposed sagacity of Constable,
recked not of the danger of this traffic. Constable himself,
inflated with a high sense of the literary property
and stock which he held, regarded himself as a rich
man, notwithstanding the large borrowings to which he
condescended. James Ballantyne, venerating both,
easy of nature, and unprepared by education or habit
to keep a rigid supervision over business matters, gave
no alarm regarding the immense compromise of his own
and his friend’s name.</p>

<p>These explanations serve so far; for what more is
necessary, it must, we fear, be admitted that the whole
group of persons concerned in the poems and novels,
including the mighty Magician himself, were naturally
enough intoxicated to a certain degree by a literary
success so infinitely exceeding all precedent. All of
them, excepting James Ballantyne, had lived in an
expensive manner. Scott himself had gone in this
respect a good way beyond what prudence dictated,
though it is also very certain that if his writings had
been published under reasonably favourable circumstances
for the realisation of profit, he might have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">72</span>
bought land, and kept house as he did, without injury
to anybody. All, moreover, had been culpably negligent
about accounts and bargainings—Scott ridiculously
so, to his own injury, as there appears no good reason
for his dividing the six or eight thousand pounds realised
by the first issues of his novels with his booksellers, to
whom a commission on sales would have been remuneration
sufficient. There was, however, at that time a much
more loose and heedless fashion in most business affairs
than now prevails, and this requires that some allowance
should be made with regard to individual cases. So it
was that one of the firmest, and, generally speaking,
most sagacious men of his time, discovered, in the
course of January 1826, that he was involved in obligations
far exceeding the extent of his whole fortune—was,
in short, a ruined man.</p>

<p>On the 18th December 1825, fearing bad news of
Constable’s affairs, he says, in a diary which he kept, and
surely few more touching words have ever fallen from
any man’s pen: ‘Men will think pride has had a fall.
Let them indulge their own pride in thinking that my
fall will make them higher, or seem so at least. I have
the satisfaction to recollect that my prosperity has been
of advantage to many, and to hope that some at least
will forgive my transient wealth, on account of the
innocence of my intentions, and my real wish to do
good to the poor. Sad hearts, too, at Darnick and in
the cottages of Abbotsford. I have half resolved never
to see the place again. How could I tread my hall
with such a diminished crest?—how live a poor indebted
man, where I was once the wealthy, the honoured? I
was to have gone there on Saturday, in joy and prosperity,
to receive my friends. My dogs will wait for me<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">73</span>
in vain. It is foolish—but the thoughts of parting from
these dumb creatures have moved me more than any of
the painful reflections I have put down. Poor things!
I must get them kind masters. There may be yet those
who, loving me, may love my dog, because it has been
mine. I must end these gloomy forebodings, or I shall
lose the tone of mind with which men should meet
distress. I feel my dogs’ feet on my knees—I hear
them whining and seeking me everywhere. This is
nonsense, but it is what they would do could they know
how things may be.’</p>

<p>The evil day had not yet come in all its reality. Mr
Constable went to London, to endeavour to raise money
on the copyrights he possessed, in order to put over the
difficulties. Moderate-minded men of the present day
read, as of something belonging to a different state of
society, of this ‘Napoleon of the realms of print’ seriously
expecting to raise one or two hundred thousand
pounds on the pledge of his copyrights, one large section
of which afterwards, at a fair auction, brought only
£8500; his whole property being such as only in the
long-run to pay 2s. 9d. a pound upon debts amounting
to £256,000. Having utterly failed in raising money
on any terms amongst those who deal in it, he induced
Scott to advance him ten thousand, which the Laird of
Abbotsford was only able to do by acting upon a right
he had reserved in his son’s marriage-contract to borrow
that sum on the security of his estate, for the benefit of
his younger children. And this last sacrifice for Mr
Constable he afterwards, very naturally, grudged more
than all the rest. It was on the 17th of January that
Scott finally ascertained the ruin of his affairs. ‘It was
hard, after having fought such a battle,’ as he says in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">74</span>
his diary; but he sustained the first shock with Roman
firmness. His resolution was immediately taken, to
accept of no grace from his creditors beyond time.
‘God grant me health and strength,’ he said in deep
solemnity to his several friends, ‘and I will yet pay
every man his due.’ To those marvellous powers which
he had exerted for the purpose of buying land and
keeping state, he trusted for the means of clearing off
the tremendous encumbrance which had fallen upon
him. At the same time, <em>state</em> was to be given wholly
up. He resolved to sell his house in Edinburgh—‘dear
39’—and use a common lodging while obliged to attend
his duties in the Court of Session. At other times he
would join his family in strict retirement at Abbotsford,
which obviously could have been put to no better use.
There was no bravado in all this—nothing but a good,
sound, honest resolution to redeem the painful obligations
into which his imprudence had hurried him. In
the same frame of mind, he declined many offers of
money made to him by friends.</p>

<p>He was engaged at the time of his misfortunes in
writing the <i>Life of Bonaparte</i>, taking up his new novel
of <i>Woodstock</i> at intervals, by way of relief. These tasks
he continued with steady perseverance in the midst of
all his distresses. Even on the day which brought him
assurance of the grand catastrophe, he resumed in the
afternoon the task which had engaged him in the morning.
There was more triumph over circumstances here
than might be supposed, for he had lately begun to feel
the first touches of the infirmities of age—age, to which
ease, not hard work, is naturally appropriate. His sleep
was now less sound than it had been; his eyesight was
failing; and, above all, he felt that backwardness of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">75</span>
intellectual power which is inseparable from years. The
will, however, was green as ever, and, under the prompting
of an honourable spirit, it did its work nobly.
Doggedly, doggedly did this glorious old man rouse
himself from his melancholy couch, and set to his task
at an hour when gaiety has little more than sought his.
Firmly did he keep to his desk during long hours, till
he could satisfy himself that he had done his utmost.
The temptations of society, the more insinuating claims
of an overworked system for rest, were alike resolutely
rejected. The world must ever hear with wonder, that
between the third day after his bankruptcy and the
fifteenth day thereafter, he had written a volume of
<i>Woodstock</i>, although several of these days had been
spent in comparative vacancy, to allow the imagination
time for brooding. He believed that, for a bet, he
could have written this volume <em>in ten days</em>! Just a
fortnight after his final breach with fortune, he says in
his journal: ‘I have now no pecuniary provisions to
embarrass me, and I think, now the shock of the discovery
is past and over, I am much better off on the
whole.... I shall be free of a hundred petty public
duties imposed on me as a man of consideration—of
the expense of a great hospitality—and, what is better,
of the waste of time connected with it. I have known
in my day all kinds of society, and can pretty well
estimate how much or how little one loses by retiring
from all but that which is very intimate.... If I could
see those about me as indifferent to the loss of rank as
I am, I should be completely happy. As it is, time
must salve that sore, and to time I trust it.’ With such
philosophy could Scott regard his reverses, even in the
very crisis of their occurrence, and yet from many other<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">76</span>
passages we find a keen sensibility to the circumstances
of his downfall. It was rectitude of mind, and not
stoicism, which enabled him to rise above his misfortunes.
Nothing, indeed, of sensibility appeared in
his external demeanour, even to his children. To them,
as to the world, it must have been a lost secret, but for
his diary.</p>

<p>The obligations of James Ballantyne and Company—that
is, of Sir Walter Scott—were finally ascertained to
amount to £117,000, of which only £46,000 were the
proper liabilities of his company.</p>

<p>Early in spring, the ministry made an effort to correct
the unsound state of things which had led to the late
fatal mania, by attempting to pass a bill for the limitation
of bank circulation. It was determined to suppress all
notes under five pounds. In Scotland, where there is a
vast faith in the utility of one-pound bank-notes, and no
other circulation is so much liked, this measure was
very unpopular. By the banks, it was regarded as
fraught with ruin to their interests. Scott, who had
disapproved of some recent changes affecting old
Scottish institutions, and whose mind, serene as it was,
perhaps required some kind of vent for its own vexations,
was led to take a strong, perhaps exaggerated
view of this question, under which he wrote three letters,
in the character of Malachi Malagrowther, originally
published in a newspaper, afterwards as a pamphlet.
His great humour and fund of droll anecdote gave wings
to this production, and helped to rouse the Scottish
people to an attitude of resistance, to which, in the
long-run, the ministry gave way. The affair presented
Scott in a new light—namely, as one setting himself up
against authority, and appealing to popular sentiment on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">77</span>
the adverse side. The public was somewhat surprised;
the ministers, some of whom were his friends, felt hurt
at opposition from such a quarter; and there was
actually some dryness between him and Lord Melville
for a short time. The explanation is, that Scott never
was a servile friend of power, but one only as far as his
view of what was good for the country led him; and
there was a manliness and independence in his character
which admitted of no hesitation about a course, when
he saw only men on the one side, and the land of his
birth on the other. It is gratifying to think that Scott
lost no friendship by his conduct on this occasion, beyond
a temporary coldness on the part of a few persons.</p>

<p>The novel of <i>Woodstock</i> came rapidly to completion,
and, early in April, the first edition of it was sold in the
printed sheets for £8228, in itself a proof that the
author might have all along had a better market for his
works if he had chosen. This was a cheering omen of
what he was to do for his creditors. Removing at the
close of the winter session to Abbotsford, he continued
there his habits of application with unabated vigour,
although, as appears from the diary, not without some
battlings between duty and inclination. The daily
amount of work he set to himself in the writing of
Napoleon’s life was four sheets of manuscript a day,
making about twenty-four of the printed pages. We
find him on one occasion finishing this before noon—a
surprising effort, considering that reference to his
authorities or materials must have often been necessary
during the progress of the work. At the same time he
commenced another work of fiction, a series of tales
entitled <i>Chronicles of the Canongate</i>, for he felt the one
task as a relief to the other.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">78</span></p>

<p>He now of course received no company at his rural
retreat. Only a few intimate friends of his neighbourhood
occasionally joined the family circle. It was a
melancholy spring to one whose life in the country had
hitherto been a constant holiday. To add to his griefs,
the health of his wife had sunk to a low pitch. His
kind-hearted Charlotte died on the 16th of May, of
water in the chest, the end being somewhat accelerated
by the late disasters. Scott, absent at the moment on
duty in Edinburgh, quickly hurried home. The event
itself, and the grief of his younger daughter on the
occasion, powerfully affected him. He thus communes
with himself in his journal: ‘It would have been
inexpressibly moving to me as a stranger—what was it,
then, to the father and the husband! For myself, I
scarce know how I feel—sometimes as firm as the Bass
Rock, sometimes as weak as the water that breaks on it.
I am as alert at thinking and deciding as I ever was in
my life. Yet, when I contrast what this place now is
with what it has been not long since, I think my heart
will break. Lonely, aged, deprived of my family—all
but poor Anne; an impoverished, an embarrassed man,
deprived of the sharer of my thoughts and counsels, who
could always talk down my sense of the calamitous
apprehensions which break the heart that must bear
them alone. Even her foibles were of service to me,
by giving me things to think of beyond my weary self-reflections.’</p>

<p>Allowing himself little rest for the indulgence of grief,
he quickly resumed, or rather hardly interrupted his
usual employments. Between the 12th of June and the
12th of August he wrote the fourth volume of <i>Napoleon</i>,
besides a portion of his novel. Thus he wrought all the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">79</span>
summer, and part of the autumn, till it was found
necessary that he should pay a visit to London and
Paris, in order to consult documents necessary for
<i>Napoleon</i>. This journey occupied six weeks, and
perhaps was useful as a rally to his spirits. It is hardly
necessary to say that, with high and low, wherever he
went, he was an object of as cordial admiration and
interest as ever. The king, the Duke of Wellington,
and many other eminent persons, paid him marked
attentions. In France, he was treated with no less
distinction. Public papers in both countries were
placed at his disposal without reserve; and in London
he obtained an assurance that his second son, Charles,
would be employed in the diplomatic department.</p>

<p>Till the failure of Messrs Constable and Company,
the Waverley secret was kept inviolate, though intrusted,
as he has himself acknowledged, to a considerable
number of persons. The inquiries which took place
into the affairs of the house rendered it no longer
possible to conceal the nature of its connection with Sir
Walter Scott; and he now accordingly stood fully
detected as the Author of <i>Waverley</i>, though he did not
himself think proper to make any overt claim to the
honour. It may be mentioned that, at the time of the
failure, Sir Walter was in possession of bills for the
novel of <i>Woodstock</i>, of which but a small part had as
yet been written. A demand was made by the creditors
of Messrs Constable and Company upon the creditors
of Sir Walter Scott, for the benefits of this work, when
it should be made public. But the author, not reckoning
this either just or legal, was resolved not to comply.
The bills, he said, were a mere promise to pay; since,
then, he had only promised to write, and they to pay,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">80</span>
he would simply not write, and then the transaction
would fall to the ground. On the claim being farther
pressed, he said: ‘The work is in my head, and there
it shall remain.’ The question, however, was eventually
submitted to arbitration, and decided in favour of the
creditors of the author, for whose behoof the work was
soon after published.</p>

<p>The fact of the authorship continued to waver between
secrecy and divulgement till the 23d of February 1827,
when Sir Walter presided at the first annual dinner of
the Edinburgh Theatrical Fund Association, in the
Assembly Rooms. There Lord Meadowbank, in proposing
the health of the chairman, used language to the
following effect: ‘It was no longer possible, consistently
with the respect to one’s auditors, to use upon this
subject terms either of mystification, or of obscure or
indirect allusion. The clouds have been dispelled; the
<em>darkness visible</em> has been cleared away; and the Great
Unknown—the Minstrel of our native land—the mighty
Magician who has rolled back the current of time, and
conjured up before our living senses the men and
manners of days which have long passed away, stands
revealed to the hearts and the eyes of his affectionate and
admiring countrymen.’ Sir Walter, though somewhat
taken by surprise, immediately resolved to throw off the
mantle, which was getting somewhat tattered. ‘He did
not think,’ he said, ‘that, in coming here to-day, he
would have the task of acknowledging before three hundred
gentlemen a secret which, considering that it was
communicated to more than twenty people, had been
remarkably well kept. He was now before the bar of
his country, and might be understood to be on trial
before Lord Meadowbank as an offender; yet he was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">81</span>
sure that every impartial jury would bring in a verdict
of <em>Not Proven</em>. He did not now think it necessary to
enter into the reasons of his long silence. Perhaps
caprice had a great share in it. He had now to say,
however, that the merits of these works, if they had any,
and their faults were entirely imputable to himself.’
[Here the audience broke into an absolute shout of
surprise and delight.] ‘He was afraid to think on
what he had done. “Look on’t again I dare not.”
He had thus far unbosomed himself, and he knew that
it would be reported to the public. He meant, then,
seriously to state that, when he said he was the author,
he was the total and undivided author. With the
exception of quotations, there was not a single word
written that was not derived from himself, or suggested
in the course of his reading. The wand was now
broken, and the rod buried. His audience would allow
him further to say, with Prospero: “Your breath has
filled my sails.”’</p>

<p>The spring of 1827 was past, and summer had gone
to June, ere Scott’s great task was completed. He then
finished the last volume of his <i>Life of Napoleon</i>, which
he had been engaged upon for about two years, but had
actually written in scarcely more than a twelvemonth of
continuous time. The paper and print of the first and
second editions, in nine volumes, brought the creditors
£18,000—an amount of gain, in relation to amount of
labour, unexampled in the history of literature, and
which will probably have no parallel for ages to come.
The book was unfortunate in its excessive length; and,
written in such haste, it could not be expected to be
very perfect, either in style or in facts. Yet it made a
tolerably fair impression on the public, and it has since<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">82</span>
rather advanced than receded in public esteem. The
contrast between the manner of its composition and
that of Hume, Robertson, and Gibbon’s works, is
startling. All of these narratives were the study and
the production of years. It had never till now entered
the head of man to think of a great historical task being
executed in a twelvemonth. The last-century historians
filed and polished their writings sentence by sentence—Scott
did not once reperuse the matter which had flowed
from his pen. And all this labour had been performed
in the midst of grief and shaken health, and without
interfering with official duties, one of which called for
several hours a day during five months of the twelve.</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="toclink_82">LATER EXERTIONS.</h2>
</div>

<p>Immediately on concluding <i>Napoleon</i>, he commenced
another historical work, his delightful <i>Tales of a Grandfather</i>;
presenting a selection of the most striking points
from the Scottish chroniclers, in a style designed to suit
the intelligence of his descendant, ‘Hugh Littlejohn.’
This he carried on alternately with his <i>Chronicles of the
Canongate</i>, the first series of which appeared early in the
ensuing winter, and was well, though not brilliantly
received. He underwent at this period some harassment
from a Jewish London house, holding one of
Constable and Company’s bills for £2000. With a
view to forcing payment by some means, they threatened
Scott with arrest; and he actually contemplated at one
moment resorting to that sanctuary (Holyrood), in
which he placed his imaginary hero, Chrystal Croftangry.
At length the vexation was taken off his head by Sir
William Forbes, the leading member of a banking<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">83</span>
company who were amongst his chief creditors. This
generous man paid the sum out of his own pocket,
without letting Scott suppose but that it was arranged
for by the body of creditors. It is pleasant to know
that Scott unconsciously underwent several obligations
of this nature on the part of other old friends. The
first series of the <i>Tales of a Grandfather</i> appeared
before the end of 1827, and was hailed with more
rapture than any work of his for several years. This
was the date of another happy circumstance of a more
important kind. The copyrights of his novels and of
a large proportion of his poetical writings being presented
for sale by Constable and Company’s creditors,
a purchase of them was made for £8500, on the part of
his own creditors as half-sharers, while the other half
belonged to Mr Robert Cadell, a member of Constable’s
late house, now independently in business. It was
designed that the novels should be republished by Cadell
in a comparatively cheap form, with notes and prefaces
by the author, and certain trinkets of embellishment,
such as—according to his own phrase—elderly beauties
are supposed to require. It was hoped that the share of
profits due to his creditors would tell materially to the
reduction of the debts; and this hope was more than
realised. Meanwhile, a first dividend was paid to these
gentlemen from the aggregate gains of Scott’s pen
during the two past years, amounting very nearly to
the unheard-of sum of £40,000. Such were the first-fruits
of that hardy industry which he had determined
to exert for the redemption of his credit and good
name.</p>

<p>Scott’s conduct and demeanour towards his old
associates in business affairs become a matter of some<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">84</span>
importance, as it too often happens that commercial
adversity introduces wrath into such fraternities. It is
pleasant to relate, that even towards Mr Constable, who
had been the cause of so much loss, he maintained a
friendly bearing. He did not, indeed, shut his eyes to
the new view he had obtained of Mr Constable’s
character as a man of business; but though he could
trust no longer, he was far from hardening his heart.
One thing he felt sorely—his last advance for Constable
when in the jaws of ruin. Nor was it a soothing
circumstance that the bookseller had endeavoured
to get his credit for £20,000 more, which would have
only been an additional loss at the speedy and inevitable
day of reckoning. Still, he was willing to regard
all this as only the effect of sanguine calculations; and
accordingly all his expressions regarding the fallen
publisher, both in his diary and his letters, are of a mild
and even kindly tenor. Mr Cadell, on the other hand,
had secured Sir Walter’s esteem and confidence by an
honest warning which he gave as to the above £20,000.
From the first, he determined to befriend this member
of the late house in preference to the other. With
regard to James Ballantyne, Scott told him, on the very
day when ruin was declared, that he would never forsake
him. Mr Ballantyne now conducted business on his
own account, and was honoured with the steady friendship
and patronage of his old schoolfellow, as of yore.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the conduct of Scott’s immediate
dependants had been highly creditable. Deeply attached,
in consequence of his long-enduring kindness, all were
anxious to remain, if possible, about his person. His
butler, Dalgleish, said he would take any or no wages,
but go he would not. His coachman, Peter Matheson,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">85</span>
went to work with his horses at the plough, glad to the
core that he was allowed to remain at Abbotsford on
such terms.</p>

<p>The spring of 1828 gave the world <i>The Fair Maid of
Perth</i>, his last popular novel. He then indulged in a
little relaxation, by spending a few weeks in London,
in the enjoyment of Mr and Mrs Lockhart’s society, as
well as that of many attached friends. We have at this
time a valuable addition to that testimony to his temper
which the second last paragraph affords. He had some
years before engaged his credit for £1200 in favour of
his friend Daniel Terry the actor, who was then undertaking
the management of the Adelphi Theatre. Being
now informed of the ruin of Mr Terry’s affairs, he wrote
him a letter, in which the following passage occurs:
‘For my part, I feel as little title, as God knows I have
the wish, to make any reflections on the matter, beyond
the most sincere regret on your own account. The sum
for which I stand noted in the schedule is of no consequence
in the now more favourable condition of my
affairs.... I told your solicitor that I desired he
would consider me as a friend of yours, desirous to
take, as a creditor, the measures which seemed best to
forward your interest.’ These are precious things to
put into a biography; but they do not exhaust the list.
Even while drudging so hard for the means of diminishing
his own encumbrances, he is found pretty frequently
composing and giving away a paper for the benefit
of some unfortunate man of letters, little regarding,
perhaps, the strict merits of the object of his bounty.
One of the most remarkable of these benefactions consisted
in his allowing the publication of two religious
discourses for the benefit of a young man endeared to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">86</span>
him by misfortune as well as merit. This publication
yielded £250, a sum which few other literary men
would allow to pass from their own pockets in such a
manner.</p>

<p>A great part of his time was now taken up with the
new writing connected with the popular edition of his
works; yet before the end of 1828 he had advanced
a good way with a new novel, the ground of which he
laid in Switzerland, notwithstanding his being acquainted
with the scenery of that country only by description and
engravings. His mind was now in a more cheerful
mood regarding his affairs than it had been since the
dreadful January 1826; and if he had been free of
various ailments, inclusive of rheumatism, caught from
a damp bed in France, he might have enjoyed his life
in the country almost as heartily as ever. Suffer as he
might, perseverance at his desk was a fixed principle
with him. Of this we have a striking trait in his finishing
<i>Anne of Geierstein</i> before breakfast one morning,
and commencing, as soon as the meal was over, a new
work, a <i>History of Scotland</i>, for Lardner’s <i>Cabinet Cyclopædia</i>.</p>

<p>The prospectus of what he called his <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">opus magnum</i>—namely,
the re-issue of the Waverley Novels—came out
in February 1829, and was so exceedingly well received
that an edition of 10,000 seemed the least he could
throw off, a number which in those days appeared
immense. When the book was published, it was quickly
found that this edition would be quite insufficient to
supply the public demand. In short, the sale of the
early volumes was not under 35,000. This was of
course magnificent success, and afforded the prognostic
of a much quicker and more easy settlement of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">87</span>
debts than had been anticipated. The volumes were
sold at five shillings. It was easy to see that, when a
certain section of the public had been supplied at that
rate, a still cheaper edition might be issued with benefit
to all concerned. Thus it might be hoped that Sir
Walter would in time rest a free man, with little help
from his own immediate exertions. His heart rebounded
at the prospect; and he even glanced at the possibility
of adding to his son’s estate before he died. The
public, too, had their visions on the subject, and, under
the idea that his embarrassments were, comparatively
speaking, at an end, the old stream of tourists and
friend-visitors began once more to pour into Abbotsford.
The only drawback was in the infirm and failing health.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="toclink_87">CONCLUDING YEARS—DECEASE.</h2>
</div>

<p>In February 1830, Scott experienced the first decidedly
bad symptom, in an attack of an apoplectic nature,
which caused him to fall speechless and insensible on
the floor. This, it seems, was a hereditary affection in
his family, and it therefore gave him the greater apprehension,
though his physicians were of opinion that the
attack proceeded from the stomach. On still went the
pen of the ready-writer, now engaged on a volume of
<i>Demonology</i> for Murray’s <i>Family Library</i>. To obtain
even more time for literary task-work, he now resigned
his clerkship on a retiring allowance of £800 a year,
and went to fix himself at Abbotsford as a permanent
residence. It was an injudicious step, as it deprived
him of the society of most of his old friends, and threw
him more and more upon that task-work which had
already been prosecuted only too zealously. His friends,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">88</span>
Cadell and Ballantyne, were now sensible that he had
carried his zeal for the discharge of his debts too far,
and would have fain restricted him to lighter duty; but
it was difficult to deal with a mind acting under such
powerful impulses. Greatly against their wishes, he
commenced a new novel, styled <i>Count Robert of Paris</i>,
which, when it appeared, shewed very clearly how glory
had departed from him. He also embroiled his mind
in the politics of the crisis then passing, and wrote a
long pamphlet against the reforming measures of the
day, which afterwards he was induced to suppress. The
exaggerated view which he took of the reform cause is
a painful chapter in his history, not merely as shewing
him unusually ill informed and weak of judgment on
passing events, but because it gave a needless addition
to anxieties of a real kind which were now pressing
severely on the springs of life. Amidst the vexations
arising to him from public affairs, one ray of pleasure
visited him when his creditors (December 1830) presented
him with his library, furniture, plate, and articles
of virtù, considered as equivalent to £10,000, thus
enabling him to make a provision for the younger
branches of his family. These gentlemen were led to
this act of generosity by their sense of his unparalleled
exertions in their behalf. Their claims against Scott
had now been reduced to £54,000, and as he had
insured £22,000 upon his life in their favour, and the
Waverley Novels were continuing to produce large
returns, all doubt of the ultimate discharge of the claims
had ceased. About this time, the honour of being
made a member of the Privy Council was offered to
him, but peremptorily declined, as unsuitable to his
circumstances.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">89</span></p>

<p>In November of the past year, Scott had had another
slight stroke of apoplexy. He lived in the most sparing
manner, yet this did not prevent a distinct paralytic
affection befalling him in April 1831. From this he
recovered, by the care of a good surgeon, in a few
days, and was then placed, by way of caution, upon extremely
low diet, which, however, he did not always
adhere to. He was now extremely infirm in walking,
and, from heedlessness, often tumbled over articles of
furniture or other impediments. The desire to be writing
continued, nevertheless, in full vigour as a ruling
passion. Here, however, he was destined to receive a
shock more terrible to him than bodily illness, when his
friends, Cadell and Ballantyne, felt it right to tell him
that his tale of <i>Count Robert of Paris</i> was, in their
opinion, an entire failure. ‘The blow is a stunning one,
I suppose’—thus he speaks in his diary—‘for I scarcely
feel it.... I am at sea in the dark, and the vessel
leaky, I think, into the bargain. I have suffered terribly,
that is the truth, rather in body than in mind, and I
often wish I could lie down and sleep without waking.
But I will fight it out if I can.’ His friends and medical
attendants strongly advised him to intermit these severe
exertions, which evidently were only a gentle form of
self-murder; but they preached to deaf ears. They
were equally unsuccessful in their endeavours to keep
him back from a county election in which he felt
interested. He went—took part in the proceedings—and
came to a collision with the populace, which could
not but leave distressing effects on one who, on all other
points, delighted to stand in kindly relations towards
the humbler classes. In the very depth of this dark
crisis he began a tale, called <i>Castle Dangerous</i>, in which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">90</span>
the failing powers of his mind became even more painfully
conspicuous. He was now fully sensible that, in
all probability, he had but a short time to live; but it
only made him the more eager to work for the acquittance
of his great obligations. So much was this the
case, that, being at a country-house in Lanarkshire on a
short visit, the intelligence of a friend having fallen down
suddenly in a fit, from which it was not expected he
would recover, caused him instantly to break up his
engagement, and go home; answering to all remonstrances
on the subject: ‘The night cometh when no
man may work.’</p>

<p>He was now advised to spend the ensuing winter in
Italy; and the government having handsomely placed a
ship at his disposal, he sailed for Naples in October,
attended by his eldest son and younger daughter. He
was most unwilling to leave home, but a long-entertained
wish to see some of the continental countries besides
France served to reconcile him to the change. The
voyage was a pleasant one: he enjoyed the objects to
be seen at Malta, so full of middle-age associations, and
thought of fictions he could found upon them. On the
17th December, he reached Naples, where everything
was done by the king and the best society of the place,
including many English, to render his residence happy.
His chief companion here was Sir William Gell, an
invalid English gentleman, who wrote upon the antiquities
of Italy, and with whom Scott at once became
extremely intimate. He beheld most of the classical
antiquities with indifference—saying only at Pompeii:
‘The city of the dead!’—but was keenly interested in
any object or document which took his mind into the
middle ages. Here he actually wrote a new tale (entitled<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">91</span>
<i>The Siege of Malta</i>), and commenced a second, neither
of which was deemed by his friends as fit to see the
light. For some time he entertained cheerful views
about his health; he was also under an impression that
his debts were all discharged: it is needless to say that
in both particulars he was deceived. Thus about four
months rolled on. He then became anxious to return
home, and, as he would not obey rule either as to
writing or his diet, it was thought best to gratify him,
in the hope that a more effectual control might there
be exercised.</p>

<p>Attended by his younger son, who had been placed
at Naples as an attaché to the embassy there, and by
his younger daughter as before, Scott left Naples for
Tweedside on the 16th of April. He paused a few
weeks at Rome, chiefly to gratify his daughter with the
sights, of which, however, he himself also partook,
beholding, as before, the medieval antiquities with the
greater share of interest. The houses occupied by the
dethroned Stuarts, and their tombs in St Peter’s, were
objects of peculiar interest in his eyes. Here, as at
Naples, he was treated by persons of the highest rank,
native and foreign, with the greatest respect. Leaving
Rome on the 11th of May, he proceeded by Venice,
through the Tyrol, to Frankfort, with a haste which
must have been unfavourable to him, but which nothing
could control. It was soon after necessary for him to
have blood let by his servant Nicolson, who had been
instructed for that purpose. On the 13th of June he
reached London, totally exhausted. It was now evident
that this illustrious man was drawing near to the end of
a greater journey. He was kept three weeks in London,
during which his friends saw in him but occasional<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">92</span>
gleams of sense. He never knew distinctly where he
was: he knew, however, that he was not at Abbotsford,
and there he yearned to be. To gratify him, he was
taken to Scotland by sea, and from Edinburgh, as soon
as possible, to his own house. As he approached it, he
began faintly to recognise familiar objects, and by and
by it was found difficult to keep him in the carriage, so
greatly was he excited. At length, alighting at the
porch, and seeing his steward and friend, he exclaimed:
‘Ha, Willie Laidlaw! O man, how often have I thought
of you!’ His dogs came about his knees, and he
sobbed over them until stupor fell again upon him. He
remained in the sad state to which he was now reduced
for two months. Sometimes the mind cleared a little,
and on one occasion he caused himself to be placed at
his desk to write, where, however, the fingers failed to
grasp the pen, and he sunk back weeping in his chair.
More generally he was in a state of slumber. When
sensible, he caused the Bible and church services to be
read to him. At length, on the 21st of September 1832,
the scene was gently closed. Sir Walter died in the
sixty-second year of his age—years undoubtedly being
cut off from the sum of his existence by that terrible
exhaustion consequent on his later literary task-work.</p>

<p>The funeral of this illustrious Scotsman was appointed
to take place on Wednesday the 26th; and, preparatory
to that melancholy ceremony, about three hundred
gentlemen were invited by Major Sir Walter Scott, the
eldest son of the deceased. Among the persons thus
called upon were many individuals whose acquaintance
of Sir Walter Scott was simply of a local character.
On an occasion like this, when the most honoured head
in the country was to be laid in the grave, it might<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">93</span>
have been expected that many individuals would have
come of their own accord, especially from the neighbouring
capital, to form part in a procession, which, however
melancholy, was altogether of a historical character.
Considering what the deceased had done for literature—what,
more specially, he had done to popularise
Scotland, its scenery, traditions, and character—we
might not unnaturally have looked for some very marked
demonstration of respect, gratitude, and affection. But
great events sometimes make less impression at the
time than they do many years after: and such was the
apathy towards this extraordinary solemnity, that only
ten or twelve persons, including the writer of this and
his brother William, had come from Edinburgh. It is
also a very remarkable circumstance, that, as in ordinary
funerals, not nearly the whole of those who had been
invited found it convenient to attend.</p>

<p>After a refection in the style usually observed on
such occasions, the funeral train set forward to Dryburgh,
where the family of the deceased possess a small
piece of sepulchral ground, amidst the ruins of the
abbey. The spot originally belonged to the Halyburtons
of Merton, an ancient and respectable baronial
family, of which Sir Walter’s paternal grandmother was
a member. It is composed simply of the area comprehended
by four pillars, in one of the aisles of the ruined
building. On a side-wall is the following inscription:
‘Sub hoc tumulo jacet <span class="smcap">Joannes Haliburtonus</span>, Barro
de Mertoun, vir religione et virtute clarus, qui obiit 17
die Augusti, 1640;’ below which there is a coat of
arms. On the back wall, the latter history of the spot
is expressed on a small tablet, as follows: ‘Hunc locum
sepulturæ D. Seneschallus, Buchaniæ comes, <span class="smcap">Gualtero,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">94</span>
homæ</span>, et <span class="smcap">Roberto Scott</span>, nepotibus Haliburtoni,
concessit, 1791.’—That is to say, the Earl of Buchan
(lately proprietor of the ruins and adjacent ground)
granted this place of sepulture, in 1791, to Walter,
Thomas, and Robert Scott, descendants of the Laird
of Halyburton. The persons indicated were the father
and uncles of Sir Walter Scott; but though all are dead,
no other member of the family lies there, besides his
uncle Robert and his deceased lady. From the limited
dimensions of the place, the body of the author of
<i>Waverley</i> was placed in a direction north and south,
instead of the usual fashion; and thus, in death at least,
he has resembled the Cameronians, of whose character
he was supposed to have given such an unfavourable
picture in one of his tales.</p>

<p>The funeral procession consisted of about sixty
vehicles of different kinds, and a few horsemen. It
was melancholy at the very first to see the deceased
carried out of a house which bore so many marks of
his taste, and of which every point, and almost every
article of furniture, was so identified with himself. But
it was doubly touching to see him carried insensible
and inurned through the beautiful scenery, which he
has in different ways rendered, from its most majestic
to its minutest features, a matter of interest unto all
time. There lay the gray and august ruin of Melrose
Abbey, whose broken arches he has rebuilt in fancy,
and whose deserted aisles he has repeopled with all
their former tenants—as lovely in its decay as ever;
while he who had given it all its charm was passing by,
unconscious of its existence, and never more to behold
it. At every successive turn of the way appeared some
object which he had either loved because it was the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">95</span>
subject of former song, or rendered delightful by his
own—from the Eildon Hills, renowned in the legendary
history of Michael Scott—to</p>

    <div class="verse indent0">‘Glanced gaily through the broom;’</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="in0">and so on to the heights above Gladswood, where
Smailholm Castle appeared in sight—the scene of his
childhood being thus brought, after all the transactions
of a mighty and glorious life, into the same prospect
with his grave.</p>

<p>During the time of the funeral, all business was
suspended at the burgh of Selkirk and the villages of
Darnick and Melrose; and in the former of these
hamlets several of the signs of the traders were covered
with black cloth, while a flag of crape was mounted
on the old tower of Darnick, which rears itself in the
midst of the inferior buildings. At every side avenue
and opening, stood a group of villagers at gaze—few
of them bearing the external signs of mourning, but
all apparently impressed with a proper sense of the
occasion. The village matrons and children, clustered
in windows or in lanes, displayed a mingled feeling of
sorrow for the loss, and curiosity and wonder for the
show. The husbandmen suspended their labour, and
leaned pensively over the enclosures. Old infirm people
sat out of doors, where some of them, perhaps, were
little accustomed to sit, surveying the passing cavalcade.
And though the feelings of the gazers had, perhaps, as
much reference to the local judge—‘the <i>Shirra</i>’—as to
the poet of the world and of time, the whole had a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">96</span>
striking effect. Those forming the procession, so far as
they could abstract themselves from the feeling of the
occasion, were also impressed with the extraordinary
appearance which it bore, as it dragged its enormous
length through the long reaches of the road—the hearse
sometimes appearing on a far height, while the rear
vehicles were stealing their way through a profound
valley or chasm. The sky was appropriately hung,
during the whole time of the ceremony, with a thick
mass of cloud, which canopied the vale from one end to
the other like a pall.</p>

<p>Towards nightfall the procession arrived within the
umbrageous precincts of Dryburgh; and the coffin,
being taken from the hearse, was borne along in slow
and solemn wise through the shady walks, the mourners
following to the amount of about three hundred. Before
leaving Abbotsford, homage had been done to the
religious customs of the country by the pronunciation
of a prayer by Dr Baird; the funeral service of the
Episcopal Church (to which the deceased belonged)
was now read in the usual manner by the Rev. John
Williams, Rector of the Edinburgh Academy, and Vicar of
Lampeter, whose distinction in literature and in scholarship
eminently entitled him to this honour. The scene
was at this time worthy of the occasion. In a small
green space, surrounded by the broken but picturesque
ruins of a Gothic abbey, and overshadowed by wild
foliage, just tinged with the melancholy hues of autumn,
with mouldering statuary, and broken monuments
meeting the eye wherever it attempted to pierce, stood
the uncovered group of mourners, amongst whom could
be detected but one feeling—a consciousness that the
greatest man their country ever produced was here<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">97</span>
receiving from them the last attentions that man can
pay to his brother man—which, however, in this case,
reflected honour, not from the living to the dead, but
(and to such a degree!) from the dead to the living.
In this scene, where the efforts of man seemed struck
with desolation, and those of nature crowned with
beauty and triumph, the voice of prayer sounded with
peculiar effect; for it is rare that the words of Holy
Writ are pronounced in such a scene; and it must be
confessed that they can seldom be pronounced over
such a ‘departed brother.’ The grave was worthy of
a poet—was worthy of Scott.—And so there he lies,
amidst his own loved scenes, awaiting throughout the
duration of time the visits of yearly thousands, after
which the awakening of eternity, when alone can he be
reduced to a level with other men.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="toclink_97">PERSONAL APPEARANCE.</h2>
</div>

<p>In stature, Sir Walter Scott was upwards of six feet,
bulky in the upper part of the body, but never inclining
in the least to what is called corpulency. His right
limb was shrunk from an early period of boyhood, and
required to be supported by a staff, which he carried
close to the toes, the heel turning a little inwards. The
other limb was perfectly sound, but the foot was too
long to bring it within the description of handsome.
The chest, arms, and shoulders were those of a strong
man; but the frame, in its general movements, must
have been much enfeebled by his lameness, which was
such as to give an ungainly, though not inactive appearance
to the figure. The most remarkable part of Sir
Walter’s person was his head, which was so very tall<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">98</span>
and cylindrical as to be quite unique. The measurement
of the part below the eyes was fully an inch and
a half less than that above, which, both upon the old
and the new systems of phrenology, must be held as a
striking mark of the intellectuality of his character. In
early life, the hair was of a sandy pale colour; but it
was changed by his illness in 1819 to a light gray, and
latterly had become rather thin. The eyebrows, of the
same hue, were so shaggy and prominent, that, when
he was reading or writing at a table, they completely
shrouded the eyes beneath. The eyes were gray, and
somewhat small, surrounded by humorous diverging
lines, and possessing the extraordinary property of
shutting as much from below as from above, when their
possessor was excited by a ludicrous idea. The nose
was the least elegant feature, though its effect in a front
view was by no means unpleasing. The cheeks were
firm and close; and the chin small and undistinguished.
The mouth was straight in its general shape, and the
lips rather thin. Between the nose and mouth was a
considerable space, intersected by a hollow, which gave
an air of firmness to the visage. When walking alone,
Sir Walter generally kept his eyes bent upon the ground,
and had a somewhat abstracted and even repulsive
aspect. But when animated by conversation, his
countenance became full of pleasant expression. He
may be said to have had three principal kinds of
aspects: <i>First</i>, when totally unexcited, the face was
heavy, with sometimes an appearance of vacancy,
arising from a habit of drawing the under-lip far into
his mouth, as if to facilitate breathing. <i>Second</i>, when
stirred with some lively thought, the face broke into an
agreeable smile, and the eyes twinkled with a peculiarly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">99</span>
droll expression, the result of that elevation of the
lower eyelids which has been just noticed. In no
portrait is this aspect caught so happily as in that
painted near the close of his life by Watson Gordon,
no other painter, apparently, having detected the
extraordinary muscular movement which occasions the
expression. The <i>third</i> aspect of Sir Walter Scott was
one of a solemn kind, always assumed when he talked
of anything which he respected, or for which his good
sense informed him that a solemn expression was
appropriate. For example, if he had occasion to recite
but a single verse of romantic ballad poetry, or if he
were informed of any unfortunate occurrence in the
least degree concerning the individual addressing him,
his visage altered in a moment to an expression of deep
veneration or of grave sympathy. The general tone
of his mind, however, being decidedly cheerful, the
humorous aspect was that in which he most frequently
appeared. It remains only to be mentioned, in an
account of his personal peculiarities, that his voice was
slightly affected by the indistinctness which is so general
in the county of Northumberland in pronouncing the
letter <em>r</em>, and that this was more observable when he
spoke in a solemn manner, than on other occasions.</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="toclink_99">CHARACTER.</h2>
</div>

<p>The character of Scott has already been indicated in
the tenor of his life, and it is not necessary to say much
in addition. It certainly included a wonderful amount
of the very noblest and most lovable of the qualities of
humanity—rarely, perhaps, have so many been combined
in one person. The public had a stronger sense<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">100</span>
of this in Scott’s lifetime than even now, for the revelations
made by Mr Lockhart and others regarding
his commercial affairs have had the effect of derogating
considerably from his reputation. But we venture to
predict that this is only a temporary effect. It has
damaged the ideal image only; it has not injured the
real man. Far better, we would say, to look the actual
character in the face, and judge of it from its shadows
as well as its lights; then only can we truly appreciate
even the worth and goodness of Scott, for then only do
we see a bearer of our own nature, charged with a share
of its infirmities, as well as of its glories. Admit, for
instance, that he erred in his anxiety for wealth; see,
on the other hand, what objects he had here in view!
There was nothing sordid in this passion of his—the
results were mainly used to realise a poetic dream from
which others were to derive the substantial benefits.
A large share was also devoted without a grudge to
solace the unfortunate. Grant, again, that he venerated
rank; the feeling was essentially connected with his
historic taste. He worshipped not the title or its living
bearer; his idol was constituted by the romantic associations
which it awoke—and thus he has been known to
pay far more practical respect to a poor Highland chieftain
than to a modern English peer. It may, in like
manner, be admitted that his judgments on passing
affairs were obsolete, and they may be excused by a
similar reference to his poetic habits. It was the same
romance of the brain from which we derived his novels,
that misled him on these points.</p>

<p>Sir Walter Scott possessed, in an eminent degree, the
power of imagination, with the gift of memory. If to
this be added his strong tendency to venerate past<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">101</span>
things, we at once have the most obvious features of his
intellectual character. A desultory course of reading had
brought him into acquaintance with almost all the fictitious
literature that existed before his own day, as well
as the minutest points of British, and more particularly
Scottish history. His easy and familiar habits had also
introduced him to an extensive observation of the varieties
of human character. His immense memory retained
the ideas thus acquired, and his splendid imagination
gave them new shape and colour. Thus, his literary
character rests almost exclusively upon his power of
combining and embellishing past events, and his skill in
delineating natural character. In early life, accident
threw his exertions into the shape of verse—in later life,
into prose; but, in whatever form they appear, the
powers are not much different. The same magician is
still at work, reawaking the figures and events of history,
or sketching the characters which we every day see
around us, and investing the whole with the light of a
most extraordinary fancy. His versified writings, though
replete with good feeling, display neither the high
imaginings nor the profound sympathies which are
expected in poetry; their charm lies almost entirely in
the re-creation of beings long since passed away, or the
conception of others who might be supposed to have
once existed. As some of the material elements of
poetry were thus wanting, it was fortunate that he at last
preferred prose as a vehicle for his ideas—a medium of
communication in which no more was expected than
what he was able or inclined to give, while it afforded a
scope for the delineation of familiar character, which was
nearly denied in poetry. As the discoverer and successful
cultivator of this kind of fictitious writing, Sir<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">102</span>
Walter Scott must rank among the very highest names
in British literature—Shakspeare, Milton, and Byron
being the only others who can be said to stand on the
same level.</p>

<p>Among the minor powers of his mind, humour was
one of the most prominent. Both in his prose writings
and in private conversation, he was perpetually making
droll application of some ancient adage, or some snatch
of popular literature, or some whimsical anecdote of real
life, which he happened to think appropriate to the
occasion.<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">2</a> A strong feeling of nationality was another
of the features of his character, though perhaps it ought,
in some measure, to be identified with his tendency to
admire whatever belonged to the past. He loved Scotland<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">103</span>
and Scotchmen, but, it may be remarked, fully as
much with a view to what they were, and what they did
long ago, as to their later or present condition. Of the
common people, when they came individually before
him, it cannot be said that he was a despiser: to them,
as to all who came in his way, he was invariably kind
and affable. Nevertheless, from the highly aristocratic
tone of his mind, he had no affection for the people as a
body. He seems to have never conceived the idea of a
manly and independent character in middle or humble
life; and in his novels, where an individual of these
classes is introduced, he is never invested with any
virtues, unless obedience, or even servility to superiors,
be of the number. Among the features of his character,
it would be improper to omit noticing his passion for
field-sports, and for all the machinery by which they are
carried on. He was so fond of a good horse, that the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">104</span>
present writer has seen him turn the most serious conversation,
in order to remark the strength and speed of
one of these animals which he saw passing. He has
also recorded his attachment to dogs, by being frequently
drawn with one by his side.</p>

<p>The gravest charge against Sir Walter Scott lies
undeniably in his heedlessness regarding his affairs.
Apart altogether from his accommodations to Constable
and Company, he had entered deeply into a
false system of credit on his own account; and while
much debt was consequently hanging over him, he is
found transferring the only solid security for it—his
estate—to his son. This, however, should be contemplated
in connection with all the circumstances
which we can suppose to have justified it in his own
mind. To one who was producing ten thousand a year
by his pen, and who had done so for years, who, moreover,
saw large possessions in his own hands, there
might appear no pressing reason for looking anxiously
into the accounts concerning even so large a sum of
floating debt as forty-six thousand pounds; at least to
one whose temperament, we now see, was sanguine and
ideal as ever poet manifested, though in his case usually
veiled under an air of worldly seeming. When this is
considered, the weight of the charge will, we think,
appear much lessened, though it cannot be altogether
done away. For what remains, let us reflect on the
latter days of Scott, and surely we must own that never
was fault more nobly expiated, or punishment more
nobly borne, than by the great Minstrel.</p>

<p>It is by far the greatest glory of Sir Walter Scott, that
he shone equally as a good and virtuous man, as he did
in his capacity of the first fictitious writer of the age.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">105</span>
His behaviour through life was marked by undeviating
integrity and purity, insomuch that no scandalous
whisper was ever yet circulated against him. The traditionary
recollection of his early life is burdened with no
stain of any sort. His character as a husband and
father is altogether irreproachable. Indeed, in no
single relation of life does it appear that he ever incurred
the least blame. His good sense, and good feeling
united, appear to have guided him aright through all the
difficulties and temptations of life; and, even as a politician,
though blamed by many for his exclusive sympathy
with the cause of established rule, he was always acknowledged
to be too benevolent and too unobtrusive to
call for severe censure. Along with the most perfect
uprightness of conduct, he was characterised by extraordinary
simplicity of manners. He was invariably
gracious and kind, and it was impossible ever to detect
in his conversation a symptom of his grounding the
slightest title to consideration upon his literary fame, or
of his even being conscious of it. Of all men living,
the most modest, as likewise the greatest and most
virtuous, was Sir Walter Scott.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="toclink_105">[CONCLUSION.</h2>
</div>

<p>The vast exertions made by Scott in his latter years
to redeem his financial blunders were happily successful.
Since his death, the whole of his debts have been
cleared off by the profits of his writings. More than
a generation has elapsed since his decease, yet the
popularity of his works remains unabated. Written to
satisfy no temporary feeling, but founded on a knowledge
of human character, and ever enduring and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">106</span>
elevating in their tendency, the fictions of Scott do not
seem destined to grow old or out of date. From the
frantic novel-writing of the period, too commonly the
mere rack of invention, with characters and incidents
in violation of all known experience, one turns to the
fictions of Sir Walter with undiminished, if not increasing,
delight and admiration. Mr Cadell’s interest
in the Waverley Novels having been transferred in
1851 to Messrs A. &amp; C. Black, innumerable editions
have since testified the lasting appreciation of these
interesting works, to which much justice has certainly
been done as regards the method of publication;
though, like some others among the original readers
of the fictions, we could have spared the explanatory
notes of the author, which, with all their merits,
are somewhat calculated to destroy the vraisemblance
of the respective narratives. A few years after the
death of Sir Walter, the citizens of Edinburgh
resolved to erect a monument to his memory, and the
device adopted was that magnificent Norman cross,
from plans of Mr George M. Kemp, placed in so
conspicuous a situation in Princes Street as to strike
the eye of every passing traveller. It encloses, under
open Gothic arches, a marble statue (life-size) of the
poet in a sitting posture, by a native artist, Mr John
Steell. The monument, which was completed in 1846,
is open daily for the inspection of strangers. The
cost of the structure has been upwards of £15,000.</p>

<p>There is something sorrowful in the failure of Scott’s
high hopes of founding a family. The fond dream of
his life may be said to have come to nought. He left
two sons and two daughters, who did not long survive
him. Miss Anne Scott died in London, 25th June 1833.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">107</span>
Sophia, who was married to John Gibson Lockhart, and
who, in appearance and character, most resembled her
father, died 17th May 1837. Charles Scott, the second
son, died, unmarried, while acting as an attaché to a
diplomatic embassy to Persia, 28th October 1841.
Walter, the eldest son, who succeeded to the baronetcy,
and rose to be lieutenant-colonel in the 15th Hussars,
died on his passage home from India, 8th February
1847. He was married, but left no issue, and the
baronetcy is extinct. Mrs Lockhart had three children,
John Hugh Lockhart—the ‘Hugh Littlejohn’ for whom
Scott so lovingly wrote the <i>Tales of a Grandfather</i>—who
died 15th December 1831; Walter Scott Lockhart,
an officer in the army, who died at Versailles, 10th
January 1853; and Charlotte Harriet Jane Lockhart,
who was married in 1847 to James Robert Hope,
barrister, grandson of the Earl of Hopetoun. This lady,
the last surviving child of the novelist, died at Edinburgh
26th October 1858. She had three children, two
of whom died young, the only survivor being Mary
Monica, born 2d October 1852, who is now the only
living descendant of Sir Walter Scott. Mrs Hope
having, in virtue of inheritance, succeeded to the estate
of Abbotsford, assumed with her husband the surname
Scott, in addition to that of Hope. Their daughter
is accordingly known as Miss Hope-Scott. Mr Hope-Scott,
who occupies Abbotsford, was by a second
marriage united to a sister of the present Duke of
Norfolk, 1861. All Sir Walter Scott’s brothers pre-deceased
him. The only one of them who was married
was Thomas, who left a son and three daughters.</p>

<p>In the occupancy of Mr Hope-Scott, Abbotsford
remains a central point of attraction to tourists, who,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">108</span>
for the purpose of visiting it, and also the mausoleum
at Dryburgh, make the village of Melrose the spot
to which they first direct their pilgrimage. Carefully
preserved in every respect, the mansion of Abbotsford
will be found almost in the condition in which it was
left by the great Scottish novelist. The lapse of forty
years, however, has effected great changes on the
grounds. The belts and clumps of plantation, the
laying out and thinning of which afforded so much
delight to Sir Walter in the days of his prosperity, when
accompanied by Tom Purdie or William Laidlaw, have
become thick, umbrageous woods, clothing with beauty
the once bare hill-sides, and otherwise realising the
anticipations of one who fondly watched over their early
development. The scene, one of the most admired in
the south of Scotland, ought not to be passed over
hurriedly. Here, within the murmuring sound of the
Tweed, Sir Walter Scott breathed his last, and here
is the memorable shrine of his affections.]</p>

<p>Looking over the correspondence and other papers of my old
friend, William Laidlaw, long since deceased, and sleeping at the
foot of a Highland hill, far from his beloved Tweedside, it occurred
to me that certain portions of the letters and memoranda might
possess interest to some readers, and not be without value to future
biographers. Mr Laidlaw, it is well known, was factor or steward
to Sir Walter Scott at Abbotsford, and also occasional amanuensis.
Lockhart has done justice to his gentle, unassuming character, and
merits, and to his familiar intercourse with the Great Minstrel.
Still, there are domestic details and incidents unrecorded, such
as we should rejoice to have concerning Shakspeare at New
Place, with his one hundred and seven acres of land in the
neighbourhood, or from Horace addressing the bailiff on his Sabine
farm. Such personal memorials of great men, if genuine and
correct, are seldom complained of, as Gibbon has observed, for
their minuteness or prolixity.</p>

<p class="in0"><span class="smcap">The</span> death of Mr William Laidlaw, a man of fine
natural powers, and of most estimable character,
removed another of the few individuals connected
directly and confidentially with the daily life and literary
history of Sir Walter Scott, and also with the revival of
the antique Minstrelsy of the Scottish Border. The loss
of Hogg, while the twilight from Scott’s departed greatness
still shone on the land, was universally regretted;
and by the death of Laidlaw, another ‘flower of the
forest,’ less bright, but a genuine product of the soil,
was ‘wede away.’ As the author of one of our sweetest
and most characteristic Scottish ballads, <i>Lucy’s Flittin’</i>,
and as a collaborateur with Scott in the collection of
the ancient minstrelsy, Laidlaw is entitled to honourable
remembrance. Let us never forget those who have
added even one wild-rose to the chaplet of Scottish
song! It is chiefly, however, as the companion and factor
or land-steward of Scott, that William Laidlaw will be
known in after-times. During most of those busy and
glorious years when Scott was pouring out so prodigally
the treasures of his prose fictions, and building up his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">112</span>
baronial romance of Abbotsford, Laidlaw was his confidential
adviser and assistant. From 1817 to 1832, he
was resident on the poet’s estate, and emphatically one
of his household friends. Not a shade of distrust or
estrangement came between them; and this close connection,
notwithstanding a disparity in circumstances
and opinions, in fame and worldly consequence, is too
honourable to both parties to be readily forgotten. The
manly kindness and consideration of one noble nature
was paralleled by the affectionate devotion and admiration
of another; and literary history is brightened by
the rare conjunction.</p>

<p>Scott’s early excursions to Liddesdale and Ettrick
form one of the most interesting epochs of his life. He
was then young, not great, but prosperous, high-spirited,
and overflowing with enthusiasm. His appointment as
sheriff had procured him confidence and respect. He
had given hostages to fortune as a husband and a father,
and no one felt more strongly the force and tenderness
of those ties. Friends were daily gathering round him;
his German studies and ballads inspired visions of literary
distinction; and he was full of hope and ambition.
In his Border raids, he revelled among the choice
and curious stores of Scottish poetry and antiquities.
Almost every step in his progress was marked by some
memorable deed or plaintive ballad—some martial
achievement or fairy superstition. Every tragic tale and
family tradition was known to him. The old <em>peels</em>, or
castles, the bare hills and treeless forest, and solitary
streams were all sacred in his eyes. They told of times
long past—of warlike feuds and forays—of knights and
freebooters, and of primitive manners and customs, fast
disappearing, yet embalmed in songs, often rude and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">113</span>
imperfect, but always energetic or tender. Thus, the
Border towers, and streams, and rocks were equally dear
to him as memorials of feudal valour, and as the scenes
of lyric poetry and pastoral tranquillity. He contrasted
the strife and violence of the warlike Douglases, the
Elliots, and Armstrongs, with the peace and security of
later times, when shepherds ranged the silent hill, or
Scottish maidens sang ancient songs, and, like the Trojan
dames,</p>

  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">‘Washed their fair garments in the days of peace.’</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="in0">Much of this romance was in the scene, but more was
in the mind of the beholder.</p>

<p>William Laidlaw’s acquaintance with Scott commenced
in the autumn of 1802, after two volumes of the <i>Minstrelsy</i>
had been published, and the editor was making
collections for a third. The eldest son of a respectable
sheep-farmer, Mr Laidlaw was born at Blackhouse,
Selkirkshire, in November 1780. He had received a
good education, had a strong bias towards natural
history and poetry, was modest and retiring, and of
remarkably mild and agreeable manners. The scheme
of collecting the old ballads of the Forest was exactly
suited to his taste. Burns had filled the whole land with
a love of song and poetry, James Hogg was his intimate
friend and companion. Hogg had been ten years a
shepherd with Mr Laidlaw’s father, had taught the
younger members of the family their letters, and recited
poetry to the old, and was engaged in every <em>ploy</em> and
pursuit at Blackhouse, the name of the elder Laidlaw’s
farm.</p>

<p>A solitary and interesting spot is Blackhouse!—a wild
extensive sheep-walk, with its complement of traditional<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">114</span>
story, and the suitable accompaniment of a ruined tower.
The farm lies along the Douglas Burn, a small mountain-stream
which falls into the Yarrow about two miles from
St Mary’s Loch. Near the house, at the foot of a steep,
green hill, and surrounded with a belting of trees, is
Blackhouse Tower, or the Tower of Douglas, so called,
according to tradition, after the Black Douglas, one of
whose ancestors, Sir John Douglas of Douglas-burn, as
appears from Godscroft’s history of the family, sat in
Malcolm Canmore’s first parliament. The tower has
in one corner the remains of a round turret, which
contained the stair, and the walls rise in high broken
points, which altogether give the ruin a singular and
picturesque appearance. It is also the scene of a
popular ballad, <i>The Douglas Tragedy</i>, in which, as in
the old Elizabethan dramas, blood is shed and horrors
are accumulated with no sparing hand. A knightly
lover, the ‘Lord William’ of so many ballads, carries
off a daughter of Lord Douglas, and is pursued by this
puissant noble and his seven sons. All these are slain
by Lord William, while the fair betrothed looks on,
holding his steed; and the lover himself is mortally
wounded in the combat, and dies ere morn. The lady
also falls a prey to her grief; and, in the true vein of
antique story and legend, we are told</p>

<div class="poetry-container w20">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indentsq">‘Lord William was buried in St Mary’s kirk,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Lady Margaret in Mary’s quire;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Out o’ the lady’s grave grew a bonny red rose,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And out o’ the knight’s a brier.’</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="in0">The tower and legend interested Scott as they had done
Laidlaw. He listened attentively to the traditionary
narrative, and, like the lovers in the ballad,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">115</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container w15">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indentsq">‘He lighted down to take a drink</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Of the spring that ran sae clear,’</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="in0">and visited the seven large stones erected upon the
neighbouring heights of Blackhouse to mark the spot
where the seven brethren were slain.</p>

<p>Mr Laidlaw was prepared for Scott’s mission. He
had heard from a Selkirk man in Edinburgh, Mr Andrew
Mercer—a Border rhymester, and connected with the
<i>Edinburgh Magazine</i>—that the sheriff was meditating
a poetical raid into Ettrick, accompanied by John
Leyden, and he had written down various ballads from
the recitation of old women and the singing of the
servant-girls. He had also enlisted the Ettrick Shepherd
into this special service. The following is one of Hogg’s
rambling bizarre epistles, which relates chiefly to the
ballad of the Outlaw Murray:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>‘<span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>—I received yours, with the transcript, on
the day before St Boswell’s Fair’ [17th of July], ‘and am
sorry to say it will not be in my power to procure you
manuscripts of the two old ballads, especially as they
which Mr Scott hath already collected are so near being
published. I was talking to my uncle concerning them,
and he tells me they are mostly escaped his memory,
and they really are so—in so much, that of the whole
long transactions betwixt the Scottish king and Murray,
he cannot make above half-a-dozen of stanzas to metre,
and these are wretched. He attributed it to James V.,
but as he can mention no part of the song or tale from
whence this is proven, I apprehend, from some expressions,
it is much ancienter. Upon the whole, I think
the thing worthy of investigation—the more so as he’
[Murray of the ballad] ‘was the progenitor of a very<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">116</span>
respectable family, and seems to have been a man of
the utmost boldness and magnanimity. What way he
became possessed of Ettrick Forest, or from whom he
conquered it, remains to me a mystery. When taken
prisoner by the king at Permanscore, above Hanginshaw,
where the traces of the encampments are still visible,
and pleading the justice of his claim to Ettrick Forest,
he hath this remarkable expression:</p>

<div class="poetry-container w20">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indentq">“I took it from the Soudan Turk</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">When you and your men durstna come see.”<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">3</a></div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="in0">Who the devil was this Soudan Turk? I would be
very happy in contributing any assistance in my power
to the elucidating the annals of that illustrious and
beloved though now decayed house, but I have no
means of accession to any information. I imagine the
whole manuscript might be procured from some of the
connections of the family. Is it not in the library at
Philiphaugh?<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">4</a> As to the death of the Baron of Oakwood
and his brother-in-law on Yarrow, if Mr Mercer
or Mr Scott, or either of them, wisheth to see it poetically
described, they might wait until my tragedy is
performed at the Theatre-royal; and if that shall never
take place, they must sit in darkness and the shadow of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">117</span>
death for what light the poets of Bruce’s time can afford
them!</p>

<p>‘I believe I could get as much from these traditions
as to make good songs out of them myself. But without
Mr Scott’s permission this would be an imposition;
neither would I undertake it without an order from him
in his own handwriting, as I could not bring my language
to bear with my date. As a supplement to his
songs, if you please, you may send him the one I sent
last to you: it will satisfy him, yea or nay, as to my
abilities. Haste; communicate this to him; and ask
him if, in his researches, he hath lighted on that of
John Armstrong of Gilnockie Hall, as I can procure
him a copy of that. My uncle says it happened in the
same reign with that of Murray, and if so, I am certain
it has been written by the same bard. I could procure
Mercer some stories—such as the tragical, though well-authenticated
one of the unnatural murder of the son
and heir of Sir Robert Scott of Thirlstane, the downfall
of the family of Tushilaw, and the horrid spirit that
still haunts the Alders. And we might give him that
of John Thomson’s Aumrie, and the Bogle of Bell’s
Lakes.</p>

<p>‘My muse still lies dormant, and with me must sleep
for ever, since a liberal public hath not given me what
my sins and mine iniquities deserved.—I am yours for
ever.</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">James Hogg.</span>
</p>

<p>‘<i>July 20th, 1801.</i>’</p>
</div>

<p>The ‘liberal public’ had given a reception ‘the north
side of friendly,’ as Bailie Nicol Jarvie says, to a small
publication which made its appearance about six months
before the date of the above letter, entitled ‘<i>Scottish<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">118</span>
Pastorals, Poems</i>, &amp;c., by James Hogg, Farmer at
Ettrick’—a most unlucky speculation.</p>

<p>Mr Laidlaw was constantly annoyed, he said, to find
how much the affectation and false taste of Allan
Ramsay had spoiled or superseded many striking and
beautiful old strains of which he got traces and fragments,
and how much Scott was too late in beginning his
researches, as many aged persons, who had been the
bards and depositaries of a former generation, were
then gone.</p>

<p>‘I heard,’ he says, ‘from one of our servant-girls,
who had all the turn and qualifications for a collector,
of a ballad called <i>Auld Maitland</i>, that a grandfather of
Hogg’s could repeat, and she herself had several of the
first stanzas (which I took a note of, and have still the
copy). This greatly aroused my anxiety to procure the
whole, for this was a ballad not even hinted at by
Mercer in his list of desiderata received from Mr Scott.
I forthwith wrote to Hogg himself, requesting him to
endeavour to procure the whole ballad. In a week or
two, I received his reply, containing <i>Auld Maitland</i>
exactly as he had copied it from the recitation of his
uncle, Will Laidlaw of Phawhope, corroborated by his
mother, who both said they learned it from their father,
a still older Will of Phawhope, and an old man called
Andrew Muir, who had been servant to the famous Mr
Boston, minister of Ettrick.’<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">5</a> These services of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">119</span>
olden time were marked by reciprocal kindness and
attachment, not unworthy of the patriarchal age. Son
succeeded father in tending the <em>hirsel</em> or herding the
cows, while in the case of ‘the master,’ the same
hereditary or family succession was often preserved.</p>

<p>The person of the sheriff was not unknown to the
new friend with whom he was afterwards destined to
form so intimate a connection. ‘I first saw Walter
Scott,’ Laidlaw used to relate, ‘when the Selkirk troop
of yeomanry met to receive their sheriff shortly after
his appointment. I was on the right of the rear rank,
and my front-rank man was <i>Archie Park</i>, a brother of
the traveller. Our new sheriff was accompanied by a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">120</span>
friend, and as they retired to the usual station of the
inspecting officer previous to the charges, the wonderful
<em>springs</em> and bounds which Scott made, seemingly in the
excitation and gaiety of his heart, joined to the effect
of his fine fair face and athletic appearance, were the
cause of a general murmur of satisfaction, bordering on
applause, which ran through the troop. Archie Park
looked over his shoulder to me, and growled, in his deep
rough voice: “Will, what a strong chield that would
have been if his right leg had been like his left ane!”’</p>

<p>Scott and Leyden duly appeared at Blackhouse,
carrying letters of introduction. They put up their
horses, and experienced a homely unostentatious hospitality,
which afterwards served to heighten the delightful
traits of rustic character in the delineation of Dandie
Dinmont’s home at Charlies-Hope. If the sheriff did
not ‘shoot a blackcock and eat a blackcock too,’ the
fault was not in his entertainers. After the party had
explored the scenery of the burn, and inspected Douglas
Tower, Laidlaw produced his treasure of <i>Auld Maitland</i>.
Leyden seemed inclined to lay hands on the manuscript,
but the sheriff said gravely that <em>he</em> would read it.
Instantly both Scott and Leyden, from their knowledge
of the subject, saw and felt that the ballad was
undoubtedly ancient, and their eyes sparkled as they
exchanged looks. Scott read with great fluency and
emphasis. Leyden was like a roused lion. He paced
the room from side to side, clapped his hands, and
repeated such expressions as echoed the spirit of hatred
to King Edward and the Southrons, or as otherwise
struck his fancy. ‘I had never before seen anything
like this,’ said the quiet Laidlaw; ‘and, though the
sheriff kept his feelings under, he, too, was excited, so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">121</span>
that his <em>burr</em> became very perceptible.’ The wild Border
energy and abruptness are certainly seen in such verses
as these:</p>

<p class="in0">Scott valued this ballad and his other lyrical acquisitions
highly. In a letter to Mr Laidlaw, dated 21st
January 1803, he remarks as follows: ‘<i>Auld Maitland</i>,

of Meikledale’s <i>Tamlane</i>. It contains some highly
poetical stanzas descriptive of fairy-land, which, after
some hesitation, I have adopted, though they have
a very refined and modern cast. I do not suspect Mr
Beattie of writing ballads himself; but pray, will you
inquire whether, within the memory of man, there has
been any poetical clergyman or schoolmaster whom one
could suppose capable of giving a coat of modern
varnish to this old ballad. What say you to this, for
example?</p>

<p>Laidlaw had procured a version of another ballad,
<i>The Demon Lover</i>, which he took down from the recitation
of Mr Walter Grieve, then in Craik, on Borthwick
Water. Grieve sung it well to a singularly wild tune;
and the song embodies a popular but striking superstition,
such as Lewis introduced into his romance of <i>The Monk</i>.
To complete the fragment, Laidlaw added the 6th,
12th, 17th, and 18th stanzas; and those who consult
the ballad in Scott’s <i>Minstrelsy</i> will see how well our
friend was qualified to excel in the imitation of these
strains of the elder muse. After the party had ‘quaffed
their fill’ of old songs and legendary story, they all took
horse, and went to dine with Mr Ballantyne of Whitehope,
the uncle of Laidlaw.</p>

<p>‘There was not a minute of silence,’ says Mr Laidlaw’s
memorandum, ‘as we rode down the narrow glen,
and over by the way of Dryhope, to get a view of St
Mary’s Loch and of the Peel or Tower. When we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">123</span>
entered the Hawkshaw-doors, a pass between Blackhouse
and Dryhope, where a beautiful view of the lake
opens, Leyden, as I expected, was so struck with the
scene that he suddenly stopped, sprung from his horse
(which he gave to Mr Scott’s servant), and stood
admiring the fine Alpine prospect. Mr Scott said little;
but as this was the first time he had seen St Mary’s
Loch, doubtless more was passing in his mind than
appeared. Often, when returning home with my fishing-rod,
had I stopped at this place, and admired the effect
of the setting sun and the approaching twilight; and
now when I found it admired by those whom I thought
likely to judge of and be affected with its beauty, I felt
the same sort of pleasure that I experienced when I
found that Walter Scott was delighted with Hogg.
Had I at that time been gifted with a glimpse—a very
slight glimpse—of the second-sight, every word that
passed, and they were not few, until we reached Whitehope
or Yarrow Church, I should have endeavoured to
record. Scott, as all the world knows, was great in
conversation; and Leyden was by no means a common
person. He had about him that unconquerable energy
and restlessness of mind that would have raised him,
had he lived, very high among the remarkable men of
his native country. I cannot forget the fire with which
he repeated, on the Craig-bents, a half-stanza of an
irrecoverable <span class="locked">ballad—</span></p>

found, adopted in the reply of William of Deloraine to
the Lady of Branksome.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">124</span></p>

<p>The regret that Laidlaw here expresses at having
omitted to note down the conversation of his friends is
extremely natural, but few men could be less fitted for
such a task. He had nothing of Boswell in his mind or
character. He wanted both the concentration of purpose
and the pliant readiness of talent and power of
retention. At Abbotsford he had ample opportunities
for keeping such a record, and he was often urged to
undertake it. Scott himself on one occasion, after some
brilliant company had left the room, remarked half
jocularly, that many a one meeting such people, and
hearing such talk, would make a very lively and entertaining
book of the whole, which might some day be
read with interest. Laidlaw instantly felt it necessary
to put in a disclaimer. He said he would consider it
disreputable in him to take advantage of his position,
or of the confidence of private society, and make a
journal of the statements and opinions uttered in free
and familiar conversation. We may respect the delicacy
and sensitiveness of his feelings, but society, collectively,
would lose much by the rigid observance of such a rule.
The question, we think, should be determined by the
nature and quality of the circumstances recorded. It
must be a special, not a general case. There is nothing
more discreditable in noting down a brilliant thought
or interesting fact, than in repeating it in conversation;
while to play the part of a gossiping and malicious eavesdropper,
is equally a degradation in life and in literature.
It would have been detestable (if the idea could for a
moment be entertained) for Mr Laidlaw to pry into the
domestic details and personal feelings or failings of his
illustrious friend at Abbotsford; but we may wish that
his pen had been as ready as his ear when Scott ran<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">125</span>
over the story of his literary life and opinions, or discriminated
the merits of his great contemporaries—when
Davy expatiated on the discoveries and delights of
natural philosophy—when Miss Edgeworth painted Irish
scenes and character—when Moore discoursed of poetry,
music, and Byron—when Irving kindled up like a poet
in his recollections of American lakes, and woods, and
old traditions—when Mackintosh began with the Roman
law, and ended in Lochaber—when some septuagenarian
related anecdotes of the past—when artists and architects
talked of pictures, sculpture, and buildings—or
when some accomplished traveller and <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">savant</i> opened
up the interior of foreign courts and the peculiarities
of national manners. Many a wise and witty saying
and memorable illustration—the life-blood of the best
books—might thus have been preserved, though with
occasional <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">lacunæ</i> and mistakes; and all are now <span class="locked">lost—</span></p>

<p class="in0">and cannot be recalled. Surely society is the worse for
the loss of these racy, spontaneous fruits of intellect,
study, and observation.</p>

<p>While dinner was getting ready at Whitehope, Laidlaw
and Leyden strolled into the neighbouring churchyard
of Yarrow, and saw the tomb of Mr Rutherford,
the first minister of that parish after the Revolution, and
the maternal great-grandfather of Scott. Leyden recited
to his companion the ballads of <i>The Eve of St John</i>
and <i>Glenfinlas</i>, which naturally impressed on the hearer
a vivid idea of the poetical talents of the sheriff, and
Laidlaw felt towards him as towards an old friend. This
was increased by Scott’s partiality for dogs. He was
struck with a very beautiful and powerful greyhound<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">126</span>
which followed Laidlaw, and he begged to have a brace
of pups from the same dog, saying he had now become
a forester, as sheriff of Ettrick, and must have dogs of
the true mountain breed. ‘This request,’ said the other,
‘I took no little pains to fulfil. I kept the puppies
till they were nearly a year old. My youngest brother,
then a boy, took great delight in training them; and
the way was this: he took a long pole having a string
and a piece of meat fastened to it, and made the dogs
run in a circular or oval course. Their eagerness to
get the meat gave them, by much practice, great strength
in the loins, and singular expertness in turning, besides
singular alertness in <em>mouthing</em>, for which they were
afterwards famous. Scott hunted with them for two
years over the mountains of Tweedside and Yarrow,
and never dreamed that a hare could escape them. He
mentions them in the Introduction to the second canto
of <span class="locked"><i>Marmion</i>—</span></p>

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>After this visit, Laidlaw doubled his diligence in
gathering up fragments of the elder Muse, and the
sheriff was profuse in acknowledgments:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>‘<span class="smcap">My dear Sir</span>—I am very much obliged to you
for your letter and the enclosure. The <i>Laird o’ Logie</i>
is particularly acceptable, as coming near the real
history. Carmichael, mentioned in the ballad, was the
ancestor of the Earl of Hyndford, and captain of James
VI.’s guard, so that the circumstance of the prisoner’s
being in his custody is highly probable. I will adopt
the whole of this ballad instead of the common one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">127</span>
called <i>Ochiltree</i>. <i>Geordie</i> I have seen before: the ballad
is curious, though very rude. <i>Ormond</i> may be curious,
but is modern. The story of <i>Confessing the Queen of
England</i> is published by Bishop Percy, so I will neither
trouble you about that nor about <i>Dundee</i>. “Glendinning”
is a wrong reading: the name of the Highland
chief who carries off the lady is Glenlyon, one of the
Menzieses. Among Hogg’s ballads is a curious set of
<i>Lamington</i> or <i>Lochinvar</i>, which I incline to adopt as
better than that in the <i>Minstrelsy</i>. Who was Katherine
Janfarie, the heroine? She could hardly be a damsel
of rank, as the estate of Whitebank is an ancient patrimony
of the Pringles. I don’t know what to make of
Cockburn’s name, unless it be Perys, the modern Pierce,
which is not a common name in Scotland. I am very
much interested about the Tushilaw lines, which, from
what you mention, must be worth recovering. I forgot
to bring with me from Blackhouse your edition of the
<i>Goshawk</i>, in which were some excellent various readings.
I am so anxious to have a complete Scottish <i>Otterburn</i>,
that I will omit the ballad entirely in the first volume,
hoping to recover it in time for insertion in the third.
I would myself be well pleased to delay the publication
of all three for some time, but the booksellers are
mutinous and impatient, as a book is always injured by
being long out of print. As to the Liddesdale traditions,
I think I am pretty correct, although doubtless much
more may be recovered. The truth is that, in these
traditions, as you must have observed, old people are
usually very positive about their own mode of telling
a story, and as uncharitably critical in their observations
on those who differ from them.—Yours faithfully,</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">Walter Scott</span>.’
</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">128</span></p>

<p class="in0">Before the friends parted, Scott made a note of Hogg’s
address, and from that time never ceased to take a warm
interest in his fortunes. He corresponded with him,
and becoming curious to see the poetical Shepherd,
made another visit to Blackhouse, for the purpose of
getting Laidlaw along with him as guide to Ettrick.
The visit was highly agreeable. The sheriff’s <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">bonhomie</i>
and lively conversation had deeply interested his companion,
and he rode by his side in a sort of ecstasy as
they journeyed again by St Mary’s Loch and the green
hills of Dryhope, which rise beyond the wide expanse
of smooth water. It was a fine summer morning, and
the impressions of the day and the scene have been
recorded in imperishable verse.<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">6</a> Dryhope Tower, so
intimately associated with the memory of Mary Scott,
the ‘Flower of Yarrow,’ made the travellers stop for a
brief space; and <i>Dhu Linn</i> (where Marjory, the wife
of Percy de Cockburn, sat while men were hanging her
husband), with Chapelhope and other scenes and ruins
famous in Border tradition, deeply interested Scott. At
the west end of the Loch of the Lowes, the surrounding
mountains close in, in the face of the traveller, apparently
preventing all farther egress. At this spot, as Laidlaw
was trying to find a safe place where they might cross
the marsh through which the infant Yarrow finds its
way to the loch, Scott’s servant, an English boy, rode
up, and, touching his hat, respectfully inquired, with
much interest, where the people got their necessaries!
This unromantic question, and the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">naïveté</i> of the lad’s
manner, was a source of great amusement to the sheriff.
The day’s journey was a favourite theme with Laidlaw.
First, after passing the spots we have described, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">129</span>
horsemen crossed the ridge of hills that separates the
Yarrow from her sister stream. These hills are high
and green, but the more lofty parts of the ridge are
soft and boggy, and they had often to pick their way,
and proceed in single file. Then they followed a foot-track
on the side of a long <em>cleugh</em> or <em>hope</em>, and at last
descended towards the Ettrick, where they had in view
the level green valley, walled in by high hills of dark
green, with here and there gray crags, the church and
the old <em>place</em> of Ettrick Hall in ruins, embosomed in
trees. Scott was somewhat chafed by having left in
his bedroom that morning his watch—a valuable gold
repeater, presented to him on the occasion of his marriage—and
to Laidlaw’s ejaculations of delight he sometimes
replied quickly: ‘A savage enough place—a very
savage place.’ His good-humour, however, was restored
by the novelty of the scenes and the fine clear day, and
he broke out with snatches of song, and told endless
anecdotes, either new, or better told than ever they
were before. The travellers went to dine at Ramsey-cleugh,
where they were sure of a cordial welcome and
a good farmer’s dinner; and Laidlaw sent off to Blackhouse
for the sheriff’s watch (which he received next
morning), and to Ettrick House for Hogg, that he might
come and spend the evening with them. The Shepherd
(who then retained all his original simplicity of character)
came <em>to tea</em>, and he brought with him a bundle
of manuscripts, of size enough at least to shew his
industry—all of course ballads, and fragments of ballads.
The penmanship was executed with more care than
Hogg had ever bestowed on anything before. Scott
was surprised and pleased with Hogg’s appearance, and
with the hearty familiarity with which <i>Jamie</i>, as he was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">130</span>
called, was received by Laidlaw and the Messrs Bryden
of Ramsey-cleugh. Hogg was no less gratified. ‘The
sheriff of a county in those days,’ said Laidlaw, ‘was
regarded by the class to whom Hogg belonged with
much of the fear and respect that their <em>forbears</em>
looked up to the ancient hereditary sheriffs, who had
the power of pit and gallows in their hands; and here
Jamie found himself all at once not only the chief
object of the sheriff’s notice and flattering attention,
but actually seated at the same table with him.’ Hogg’s
genius was sufficient passport to the best society. His
appearance was also prepossessing. His clear ruddy
cheek and sparkling eye spoke of health and vivacity,
and he was light and agile in his figure. When a youth,
he had a remarkably fine head of long curling brown
hair, which he wore coiled up under his bonnet; and
on Sundays, when he entered the church and let down
his locks, the <em>lasses</em> (on whom Jamie always turned an
expressive <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">espiègle</i> glance) looked towards him with envy
and admiration. He doubtless thought of himself as
the Gaelic bard did of Allan of <span class="locked">Muidart—</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container w18">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indentsq">‘And when to old Kilphedar’s church</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Came troops of damsels gay,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Say, came they there for Allan’s fame,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Or came they there to pray?’</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Mr Laidlaw thus speaks of the evening at Ramsey-cleugh:
‘It required very little of that tact or address
in social intercourse for which Mr Scott was afterwards
so much distinguished, to put himself and those around
him entirely at their ease. In truth, I never afterwards
saw him at any time apparently enjoy company so much,
or exert himself so greatly—or probably there was no
effort at all—in rendering himself actually fascinating;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">131</span>
nor did I ever again spend such a night of merriment.
The qualities of Hogg came out every instant, and his
unaffected simplicity and fearless frankness both surprised
and charmed the sheriff. They were both very
good mimics and story-tellers born and bred; and when
Scott took to employ his dramatic talent, he soon found
he had us all in his power; for every one of us possessed
a quick sense of the ludicrous, and perhaps of
humour of all kinds. I well recollect how the tears
ran down the cheeks of my cousin, George Bryden; and
although his brother was more quiet, it was easy to see
that he too was delighted. Hogg and I were unbounded
laughers when the occasion was good. The best proof
of Jamie’s enjoyment was, that he never sung a song
that blessed night, and it was between two and three
o’clock before we parted.’</p>

<p>Next morning, Scott and Laidlaw went, according to
promise, to visit Hogg in his low thatched cottage.
The situation is fine, and the opposite mountains, from
the grand simplicity of their character, may almost be
termed sublime. The Shepherd and his aged mother—‘Old
Margaret Laidlaw,’ for she generally went by her
maiden name—gave the visitors a hearty welcome.
James had sent for a bottle of wine, of which each had
to take a glass; and as the exhilarating effects of the
previous night had not quite departed, he insisted that
they should help him in drinking every drop in the
bottle. Had it been a few years earlier in Scott’s life,
and before he was sheriff of the county, the request
would probably have been complied with; but on this
occasion the bottle was set aside. The scene was
curious and interesting. ‘Hogg may be a great poet,’
said Scott, ‘and, like Allan Ramsay, come to be the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">132</span>
founder of a sort of family.’ Hogg’s familiarity of
address, mingled with fits of deference and respect
towards the sheriff, was curiously characteristic. Many
years after this, we recollect a gentleman asking Laidlaw
about an amusing anecdote told of the Shepherd.
Hogg had sagacity enough to detect the authorship of
the Waverley novels long before the secret was divulged,
and had the volumes as they appeared bound and
lettered on the back ‘<span class="smcap">Scott’s Novels</span>.’ His friend
discovered this one day when visiting Hogg at Altrive,
and, in a dry humorous tone of voice, remarked:
‘Jamie, your bookseller must be a stupid fellow to spell
<i>Scots</i> with two <em>t</em>s.’ Hogg is said to have rejoined: ‘Ah,
Watty, I am ower auld a cat to draw that strae before.’
Laidlaw laughed immoderately at the story, but observed:
‘Jamie never came lower down than <i>Walter</i>.’ Lockhart,
however, appears to think he did occasionally
venture on such a descent.</p>

<p>From Hogg’s cottage the party proceeded up Rankleburn
to see Buccleuch, and inspect the old chapel and
mill. They found nothing at the kirk of Buccleuch,
and saw only the foundations of the chapel. Scott,
however, was in high spirits, and, being a member of
the Edinburgh Light Cavalry, and Laidlaw one of the
Selkirkshire Yeomanry, they sometimes set off at a
gallop—the sheriff leading as in a mimic charge, and
shouting: ‘Schlachten, meine kinder, schlachten!’ Hogg
trotted up behind, marvelling at the versatile powers of
the ‘wonderful <em>shirra</em>.’ They all dined together with
a ‘lady of the glen,’ Mrs Bryden, Crosslee; and next
morning Scott returned to Clovenford Inn, where he
resided till he took a lease of the house of Ashestiel.</p>

<p>Amidst these and similar scenes, Walter Scott inhaled<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">133</span>
inspiration, and nursed those powers which afterwards
astonished the world. The healthy vigour of his mind,
and his clear understanding, grew up under such training,
and his imagination was thence quickened and
moulded. Byron studied amidst the classic scenes of
Greece and Italy—Southey and Moore in their libraries,
intent on varied knowledge. All the ‘shadowy tribes
of mind’ were known to the metaphysical Coleridge.
Wordsworth wandered among the lakes and mountains
of Westmoreland, brooding over his poetical and philosophical
theories, from which his better genius, in the
hour of composition, often extricated him. Scott was
in all things the simple, unaffected worshipper of nature
and of Scotland. His chivalrous romances sprung from
his national predilections; for the warlike deeds of the
Border chiefs first fired his fancy, and directed his
researches. In these mountain excursions he imbibed
that love and veneration of past times which coloured
most of his compositions; and human sympathies and
solemn reflections were forced upon him by his intercourse
with the natives of the hills, and the simple and
lonely majesty of the scenes that he visited. These
early impressions were never forgotten. Nor could
there have been a better nursery for a romantic and
national poet. Scholastic and critical studies would
have polished his taste and refined his verse; but we
might have wanted the strong picturesque vigour—the
simple direct energy of the old ballad style—the truth,
nature, and observation of a stirring life—all that
characterises and endears old Scotland. Scott’s destiny
was on the whole pre-eminently happy; and when we
think of the fate of other great authors—of Spenser
composing amidst the savage turbulence of Ireland—of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">134</span>
Shakspeare following a profession which he disliked—of
Milton, blind and in danger—Dante in exile—and
Tasso and Cervantes in prison—we feel how immeasurably
superior was the lot of this noble free-hearted
Scotsman, whose genius was the proudest inheritance of
his country. ‘Think no man happy till he dies,’ said the
sage. Scott’s star became dim, but there was only a
short period of darkness, and he never ‘bated one jot of
heart or hope,’ nor lost the friendly and soothing
attentions of those he loved. The world’s respect and
admiration he always possessed.</p>

<p>The <i>Minstrelsy</i> appeared complete in the spring of
1803—the first two volumes being then reprinted, and a
third volume added, containing the editor’s more recent
collections. The work was very favourably received:
indeed, so valuable a contribution to our native literature
had not appeared since the publication of Percy’s
<i>Reliques</i>. And the Introduction is an admirable historical
summary, foreshadowing Scott’s future triumphs as a
prose writer.<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">7</a></p>

<p>The sheriff made four visits to Blackhouse, the fourth
time in company with his attached friend, Mr Skene of
Rubislaw. All the party turned out to visit a fox-hunt,
a successful one, for the fox was killed; and Mr Skene<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">135</span>
made a spirited drawing of the scene, including a
portrait of old Will Tweedie, the fox-hunter. The visit
was closed by the whole party riding to see the wild
scenery of the Grey Mare’s Tail and Loch Skene, Hogg
and Adam Ferguson being of the party. Laidlaw thus
writes of the expedition to Moffatdale:</p>

<p>‘We proceeded with difficulty up the rocky chasm to
reach the foot of the waterfall. The passage which the
stream has worn by cutting the opposing rocks of grey-wacke,
is rough and dangerous. My brother George
and I, both in the prime of youth, and constantly in
the habit of climbing, had difficulty in forcing our way,
and we felt for Scott’s lameness. This, however, was
unnecessary. He said he could not perhaps climb so
fast as we did, but he advised us to go on, and leave
him. This we did, but halted on a projecting point
before we descended to the foot of the fall, and looking
back, we were struck at seeing the motions of the
sheriff’s dog <i>Camp</i>. The dog was attending anxiously
on his master; and when the latter came to a difficult
part of the rock, <i>Camp</i> would jump down, look up to
his master’s face, then spring up, lick his master’s hand
and cheek, jump down again, and look upwards, as if
to shew him the way, and encourage him. We were
greatly interested with the scene. Mr Scott seemed to
depend much on his hands and the great strength of
his powerful arms; and he soon fought his way over all
obstacles, and joined us at the foot of the Grey Mare’s
Tail, the name of the cataract.’</p>

<p>This excursion, like most of the others, Scott described
in <i>Marmion</i> (Introd. to Canto II.) He was apt, on a
journey among the hills, especially if the district was
new to him, to fall at times into fits of silence, revolving<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">136</span>
in his mind, and perhaps throwing into language, the
ideas that were suggested at the moment by the landscape;
and hence those who had often been his companions
knew the origin of many of the beautiful
passages in his future works. Of this Laidlaw used to
relate one instance. About a mile down Douglas-burn,
a small brook falls into it from the Whitehope hills;
and at the junction of the streams, at the foot of a bank
celebrated in traditionary story, stood the withered remains
of what had been a very large old hawthorn tree,
that had often engaged the attention of the young men
at Blackhouse. Laidlaw on one occasion pointed out to
the sheriff its beautiful site and venerable appearance,
and asked him if he did not think it might be centuries
old, and once a leading object in the landscape. As the
district had been famous for game and wild animals, he
said there could be little doubt that the red deer had
often lain under the shade of the tree, before they
ascended to feed on the open hill-tops in the evening.
Scott looked on the tree and the green hills, but said
nothing. The enthusiastic guide repeated his admiration,
and added, that Whitehope-tree was famous for
miles around; but still Scott was silent. The subject
was then dropped; ‘but some years afterwards,’ said
Laidlaw, ‘when the sheriff read to me his manuscript
of <i>Marmion</i>, I found that Whitehope-tree was not forgotten,
and that he had felt all the associations it was
calculated to excite.’ The description of the thorn is
eminently suggestive and beautiful:</p>

<p>We may here notice another poetical scene, the <i>Bush
aboon Traquair</i>, celebrated in the well-known popular
song by Crawford. Burns says that when he saw the
old bush in 1787, it was composed of eight or nine
ragged birches, and that the Earl of Traquair had
planted a clump of trees near the place, which he called
‘The New Bush.’ Laidlaw maintained that the new
bush was in reality the old bush of the song. One of
the sons of Murray of Philiphaugh used to come over
often on foot, and meet one of the ladies of Traquair at
the <i>Cless</i>, a green hollow at the foot of the hill that
overhangs Traquair House. This was the scene of the
song. The straggling birches that Burns saw are half
a mile up the water, the remains of a wooded bog—out
of sight of Traquair House, to be sure, but far out of the
way between Hanginshaw, on the Yarrow, and Traquair.</p>

<p>One morning in autumn 1804 was vividly impressed
on the recollection of Laidlaw; for Scott then recited
to him nearly the whole of the <i>Lay of the Last Minstrel</i>,
as they journeyed together in the sheriff’s gig up Gala
Water. The wild, irregular structure of the poem, the
description of the old minstrel, the goblin machinery,
the ballads interspersed throughout the tale, and the
exquisite forest scenes (the Paradise of Ettrick), all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">138</span>
entranced the listener. Now and then, Scott would stop
to tell an anecdote of the country they were passing
through, and afterwards, in his deep <em>serious</em> voice, resume
his recitation of the poem. Laidlaw had, the night
before, gone to Lasswade, where the sheriff then resided
in a beautiful cottage on the banks of the Esk; and on
the following morning, after breakfast, they went up the
Gala, when Scott poured forth what truly seemed to be
an unpremeditated lay. They returned about sunset,
and found the sheriff’s young and beautiful wife looking
on at the few shearers engaged in cutting down their
crop in a field adjoining the cottage. Mrs Scott seemed
to Laidlaw a ‘lovely and interesting creature,’ and the
sheriff met her with undisguised tenderness and affection.
This was indeed his golden prime:</p>

<div class="poetry-container w20">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">‘How happily the days of Thalaba went by!’</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="in0">After this period, Laidlaw commenced householder,
entering on extensive farming experiments; and, so
long as the war lasted and high prices prevailed, his
schemes promised to be ultimately successful. But with
peace came a sudden fall in the market value of corn.
He struggled on with adverse circumstances for a twelvemonth,
till capital and credit failed, and he was obliged
to abandon his lease.</p>

<p>In the summer of 1817, we find him at Kaeside, on
the estate of Abbotsford. At first, this seemed a
temporary arrangement. The two friends had kept up
a constant intercourse after Scott’s visit to the Yarrow
in 1802. Presents of trout and blackcock from the
country, and return presents of books from Castle
Street, in Edinburgh, were interchanged; and, when
Laidlaw’s evil day was at hand, Scott said: ‘Come to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">139</span>
Abbotsford, and help me with my improvements. I
can put you into a house on the estate—Kaeside—and
get you some literary work from the Edinburgh publishers.’
The offer was cheerfully accepted, and the
connection became permanent. Scott had then commenced
building and planting on a large scale; and the
same year he made his most extensive purchase—the
lands of Toftfield, for which he gave £10,000.</p>

<p>‘I have more than once—such was his modesty’—said
Laidlaw, ‘heard Sir Walter assert that had his
father left him an estate of £500 or £600 a year, he
would have spent his time in miscellaneous reading,
not writing. This, to a certain extent, might have been
the case; and had he purchased the property of Broadmeadows,
in Yarrow, as he at one time was very anxious
to do, and when the neighbourhood was in the possession
of independent proprietors, the effect might have
been the same. At Abbotsford, surrounded by little
lairds, most of them ready to sell their lands as soon as
he had money to advance, the impulse to exertion was
incessant; for the desire to possess and to add increased
with every new acquisition, until it became a passion of
no small power. Then came the hope to be a large
landed proprietor, and to found a family.’</p>

<p>When the poet was in Edinburgh attending to his
official duties as Clerk of Session, he sighed for Abbotsford
and the country, and took the liveliest interest in
all that was going on under the superintendence of his
friend. Passages like the following remind us of the
writings of Gilpin and Price on forest and picturesque
scenery:</p>

<p>‘George must stick in a few wild-roses, honeysuckles,
and sweet-briers in suitable places, so as to produce the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">140</span>
luxuriance we see in the woods which Nature plants
herself. We injure the effect of our plantings, so far as
beauty is concerned, very much by neglecting underwood....
I want to know how you are forming
your glades of hard wood. Try to make them come
handsomely in contact with each other, which you can
only do by looking at a distance on the spot, then and
there shutting your eyes as you have done when a child
looking at the fire, and forming an idea of the same
landscape with glades of woodland crossing it. Get
out of your ideas about expense. It is, after all, but
throwing away the price of the planting. If I were to
buy a picture worth £500, nobody would wonder much.
Now, if I choose to lay out £100 or £200 to make a
landscape of my estate hereafter, and add so much more
to its value, I certainly don’t do a more foolish thing.
I mention this, that you may not feel limited so much
as you might in other cases by the exact attention to
pounds, shillings, and pence, but consider the whole on
a liberal scale. We are too apt to consider plantations
as a subject of the closest economy, whereas beauty and
taste have even a marketable value after the effects come
to be visible. Don’t dot the plantations with small
patches of hard wood, and always consider the ultimate
effect.’</p>

<p>It is pleasant to see from the Laidlaw manuscripts with
what alacrity and zeal the noble friends of the poet
came forward with kindly contributions. The Duke of
Buccleuch sent bushels of acorns; the Earl of Fife
presented seed of Norway pines; Lord Montagu forwarded
a box of acorns and a packet of lime-seed.
One arboricultural missive to the factor says: ‘I send
the seeds of the Corsican pine, got with great difficulty,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">141</span>
and also two or three of an unknown species which
grows to a great height on the Apennines. Dr Graham
says they should be raised in mould, finely prepared,
under glass, but without artificial heat.’ A box of fine
chestnuts came from Lisbon: the box was sent on from
Edinburgh to Abbotsford unopened, and before Laidlaw
heard of them, the chestnuts were peeled, and rendered
useless for planting. ‘Confound the chestnuts, and those
who peeled them!’ exclaimed Scott; ‘the officious blockheads
did it by way of special favour.’ One object was
to form at the top of the dikes an impenetrable copse
or natural hedge or verdurous screen—the poet uses all
the epithets (Milton has ‘verdurous wall’); and for this
purpose there were sent from Edinburgh 3000 laburnums,
2000 sweet-briers, 3000 Scotch elms, 3000 horse-chestnuts,
loads of hollies, poplars for the marshy ground,
and filberts for the glen. The graceful birch-tree, ‘the
lady of the wood,’ was not, of course, neglected. ‘I am
so fond of the birch,’ writes the poet; ‘and it makes
such a beautiful and characteristic underwood, that I
think we can hardly have too many. Besides, we may
plant them as hedges.’ He purchased at this time
about 100,000 birches. Mr Morritt of Rokeby writes
to a friend: ‘He (Scott) tells me he never was so happy
in his life as in having a place of his own to create. In
this Caledonian Eden, he labours all day with his own
hands; though, since the Fall, he and his wife will not
find many luxuriant branches to prune in Ettrick Forest
I sent him a bushel of Yorkshire acorns, which, except
docks and thistles, are, I believe, likely to be in three
years the largest vegetables upon the domain.’<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">9</a></p>

<p>‘There are many little jobs about the walks,’ writes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">142</span>
the busy and happy laird, ‘which, though Tom Purdie
contemns them, are not less necessary towards comfort:
a seat or two, for example, and covering any drains, so
as to let the pony pass. In the front of the old
Rispylaw (now Anne’s Hill) is an old quarry, which, a
little made up and accommodated with stone seats and
some earth to grow a few honeysuckles and sweet-briers,
would make a very sweet place. Many of the walks
will <em>thole</em>’ [bear] ‘a mending; for instance, that to the
thicket might be completely gravelled, as Mrs Scott uses
it so much.’</p>

<p>Here the kindly, loving nature of the man peeps out.
To Tom himself, Scott writes in a big, plain, round hand:</p>

<p>‘As Mrs Scott comes out on the 22d, and brings
some plants to cover the paling of the court, you must
have a border of about a spade’s breadth and a spade’s
depth dug nicely, and made up with good earth and a
little dung, all along in front of the paling, and along
the east end of it. She will bring the plants from Edinburgh,
so they can be put into the ground the evening
she arrives.’</p>

<p>Afterwards, as years ran on, a thread of business was
intermixed with the rural pleasure. The poet began to
calculate on the probable return from the woods, not
omitting the value of the bark used for tanning
purposes.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>‘<span class="smcap">Dear Willie</span>—How could you be such a gowk’
[fool] ‘as to suppose I meant to start a hare upon you by
my special inquiries about the bark? I am perfectly
sensible you take more care of my affairs than you
would of your own; but anything about wood or trees
amuses me, and I like to enter into it more particularly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">143</span>
than into ordinary farming operations. In particular,
this of drying and selling our bark—at present a trifle—is
a thing which will one day be of great consequence,
and I wish to attend to the details myself. I think it
should not be laid on the ground, but dried upon stools
made of the felled wood; and if you lay along these
stools the peeled trees, and pile the bark on them, it
will hide the former from the sun, and suffer them to
dry gradually. I have been observing this at Blair-Adam.
I have got a new light on larch-planting from
the Duke of Athole’s operations. He never plants
closer than eight feet, and says they answer admirably.
If this be so, it will be easy to plant our hill-ground.
Respecting the grass in the plantations, I have some
fears of the scythe, and should prefer getting a host of
women with their hooks, which would also be a good
thing for the poor folks.’ [Another touch of the poet’s
kindly nature.] ‘Tom must set about it instantly. He
is too much frightened for the expense of doing things
rapidly, as if it were not as cheap to employ twelve
men for a week as six men for a fortnight.—Yours,</p>

<p class="right">
W. S.’
</p>
</div>

<p>In the matter of dwellings for the small tenants and
labourers, the laird of Abbotsford was equally careful
and considerate. ‘I think stone partitions would be
desirable on account of vermin, &amp;c. If their houses are
not comfortable, the people will never be cleanly. For
windows I would much prefer the cast-iron lattices,
turning on a centre, and not made too large. These
windows being in small quarrels, or panes, a little breach
is easily repaired, and saves the substitute of a hat or
clout through a large hole. Certainly the cottages<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">144</span>
should be rough-plastered.’ Perhaps the little iron
lattices were as much preferred for their antique,
picturesque associations as for their utility—‘something
poetical,’ as Pope’s old gardener said of the drooping
willow; and the aged minstrel’s hut near Newark Tower,
it will be recollected, had such a window:</p>

<div class="poetry-container w18">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indentsq">‘The little garden hedged with green,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A cheerful hearth and lattice clean.’</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>When times were hard and winter severe, he thought
of the firesides of the labourers:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>‘<span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>—I have your letter, and have no doubt in
my own mind that a voluntary assessment is the best
mode of raising money to procure work for the present
sufferers, because I see no other way of making this
necessary tax fall equally upon the heritors.... I
shall soon have money, so that if you can devise any
mode by which hands can be beneficially employed at
Abbotsford, I could turn £50 or £100 extra into that
service in the course of a fortnight. In fact, if it made
the poor and industrious people a little easier, I should
have more pleasure in it than in any money I ever spent
in my life.—Yours, very truly,</p>

<p class="right">
W. S.’
</p>
</div>

<p>The same year, which was a period of some excitement
and discontent, he writes to Laidlaw:</p>

<p>‘I am glad you have got some provision for the poor.
They are the minors of the state, and especially to be
looked after; and I believe the best way to prevent discontent
is to keep their minds moderately easy as to
their own provision. The sensible part of them may
probably have judgment enough to see that they could
get nothing much better for their class in general by an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">145</span>
appeal to force, by which, indeed, if successful, ambitious
individuals might rise to distinction, but which would,
after much misery, leave the body of the people just
where it found them, or rather much worse....
Political publications must always be caricatures. As
for the mob of great cities, whom you accuse me of
despising too much, I think it is impossible to err on
that side. They are the very <em>riddlings</em> of society, in
which every useful cinder is, by various processes, withdrawn,
and nothing left but dust, ashes, and filth. Mind,
I mean the mob of cities, not the lowest people in the
country, who often, and, indeed, usually, have both
character and intelligence.’</p>

<p>Again:</p>

<p>‘I think of my books amongst this snow-storm; also
of the birds, and not a little of the poor. For benefit
of the former, I hope Peggy throws out the crumbs; and
a corn-sheaf or two for the game would be to purpose,
if placed where poachers could not come at them. For
the poor people, I wish you to distribute five pounds or
so among the neighbouring poor who may be in distress,
and see that our own folks are tolerably off.’</p>

<p>Scott introduced his friendly factor to <i>Blackwood’s
Magazine</i>, and Laidlaw used to compile for it a monthly
chronicle of events, besides occasionally contributing a
descriptive article, which the ‘Great Magician’ overhauled
previous to its transmission. There was, in the
autumn of 1817, a great combustion in Edinburgh about
the <i>Chaldee Manuscript</i>, inserted in the magazine for
October. An edition of two thousand copies was soon
sold, and fifteen hundred more were printed; so Blackwood
writes to Scott. ‘He was dreadfully afraid,’ says
Laidlaw, ‘that Mr Scott would be offended; and so he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">146</span>
would, he says, were it not on my account.’ The
Ettrick Shepherd (who was the original concocter of the
satire) was also alarmed. ‘For the love of God, open
not your mouth about the <i>Chaldee Manuscript</i>,’ he
writes to Laidlaw. ‘There have been meetings and
proposals, and an express has arrived from Edinburgh
to me. Deny all knowledge, else, they say, I am
ruined,’ &amp;c. This once famous production is so local
and personal that, although it is now included in
Professor Wilson’s works, it is almost unknown to the
present generation. The subject is a bookseller’s
quarrel, a contest between the rival magazines of
Blackwood and Constable, and it is one of the most
harmless of all the parodies couched in Scriptural
phraseology. Professor Ferrier, the editor of Wilson’s
works, says it is quite as good, in its way, as Swift’s
<i>Battle of the Books</i>; but this is a monstrous delusion.
There are some quaint touches of character in the
piece. It may be compared to the parodies by Hone;
but it is a sort of profanation to place it on a level with
the classic satire of Swift.</p>

<p>It is never too late to do justice. In one of these
magazine missives, written in January 1818, Blackwood
refers to the Ettrick Shepherd. ‘If you see Hogg, I
hope you will press him to send me instantly his <i>Shepherd’s
Dog</i>, and anything else. I received his <i>Andrew
Gemmells</i>; but the editor is not going to insert it in this
number.’ [Had Ebony really an editor, or was he not
himself the great sublime?] ‘I expected to have
received from him the conclusion of the <i>Brownie of
Bodsbeck</i>; there are six sheets of it already printed.’</p>

<p>Now, the latter part of this extract seems distinctly to
disprove a charge which Hogg thoughtlessly brought<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">147</span>
against Mr Blackwood. His novel, the <i>Brownie of
Bodsbeck</i>, was published in 1818, and he suffered
unjustly, as he states in his autobiography, with regard
to that tale, as it was looked upon as an imitation of
Scott’s <i>Old Mortality</i>. It was wholly owing to Blackwood,
he asserts, that his story was not published a
year sooner; and he relates the case as a warning to
authors never to intrust booksellers with their manuscripts.
But the fact is, <i>Old Mortality</i> was published in
December 1816; and we have Blackwood, in the above
letter to Laidlaw, stating that he had not, in January
1818—more than a twelvemonth afterwards—received
the whole of the ‘copy’ of the <i>Brownie of Bodsbeck</i>. How
could he go to press with an unfinished story? How
make bricks without straw? The accusation is altogether
a myth, or, to use one of the Shepherd’s own
expressions, ‘a mere shimmera’ [chimera] ‘of the brain.’</p>

<p>Of Hogg’s prose works, Scott writes: ‘Truly, they are
sad daubing, with, here and there, fine dashes of genius.’
The <em>daubing</em> is chiefly seen in the dialogues and
attempts at humour; the <em>genius</em> appears in the descriptions
of pastoral or wild scenery, as in the account of
the ‘Storms,’ and in the fine introduction to the <i>Brownie
of Bodsbeck</i>, and in some of the delineations of humble
Scottish life and superstition. Hogg is as true and
literal as Crabbe. His peasants always speak and think
as peasants; but he gives us, sometimes, coarse and
poor specimens. It is certain, however, that, even in
the worst of his stories, there are gleams of fancy—‘fairy
blinks of the sun’—far above the reach of writers
immensely his superiors in taste and acquirements.</p>

<p>There was another person in whom Scott was
interested with reference to the slashing articles in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">148</span>
<i>Blackwood’s Magazine</i>. He writes to Laidlaw: ‘So
they let poor Charles Sharpe alone, they may satirise all
Edinburgh, your humble servant not excepted.’ Charles
Kirkpatrick Sharpe, with his antiquarian tastes, personal
oddities, and aristocratic leanings, was a special
favourite with Scott. He was a kind of Scotch Horace
Walpole (so considered by his illustrious friend), but
much feebler; perhaps stronger with the pencil, but
infinitely weaker with the pen. His celebrated sketch
of the ‘Inimitable Virago,’ or Queen Elizabeth dancing
<em>disposedly</em>, as described by the Scotch ambassador, Sir
James Melville, was esteemed by Scott as an unrivalled
production. It is highly ludicrous and effective as a
picture, but is too extravagant to serve even as a
caricature representation of Elizabeth. Neither face
nor figure has any resemblance. Hogarth, in his etching
of old Simon Lord Lovat of the ’45, seems, by a happy
stroke of genius, to have hit the true medium in works
of this class. He preserved the strong points in personal
appearance and character—combining them with
irresistible humour and drollery of expression.</p>

<p>Here is another scrap:</p>

<p>‘I am glad to send you Maga, which continues to be
clever. I hope for two or three happy days on the
brae-sides about the birthday’ [the king’s birthday, June
4]. ‘Blackwood has been assaulted by a fellow who
came from Glasgow on purpose, and returned second-best.
The bibliopole is like the little French lawyer,
who never found out he could fight till he was put to it,
and was then for cudgelling all and sundry. You never
saw anything so whimsical.</p>

<p>‘I think often, of course, about my walks; and I am
sickening to descend into the glen at the little waterfall<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">149</span>
by steps. We could cut excellent ones out where the
quarry has been. It is the only way we shall ever make
what Tom Purdie calls a <em>neat job</em>; for a deep descent
will be ugly, and difficult to keep. I would plant
betwixt the stair and the cascade, so as to hide the
latter till you came down to the bottom.’</p>

<p>Visitors now began to appear at Abbotsford, an
increasing stream every season from 1817 to 1825.
They consisted of persons of rank and fashion, literary
men and artists of all nations, who travelled to the
Tweed to pay homage to the poet. There was no
envy or jealousy with the Great Minstrel. Indeed, with
the single exception of Byron, his position was such that
he had no cause to fear any rival, and he could afford
to throw largess to the crowd. All were welcome at
Abbotsford. Washington Irving has described the
cordial reception he experienced on the occasion of his
visit in 1817, and Laidlaw thus notes the event:</p>

<p>‘We had a long walk up by the glen and round by the
loch. It was fine sunshine when we set out, but we
met with tremendous dashing showers. Mr Irving told
me he had a kind of devotional reverence for Scotland,
and most of all for its poetry. He looked upon it as
fairy-land, and he was beyond measure surprised at Mr
Scott, his simple manners and brotherly frankness. He
was very anxious to see Hogg, and said that several
editions of Hogg’s different poems had been published
in America.’</p>

<p>Irving always regretted that he had not met with the
Shepherd. Such a meeting could not have failed to
give infinite pleasure to both. The gentle manners and
literary enthusiasm of the American author would at
once have attached the Shepherd; while the rustic<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">150</span>
frankness, liveliness, and perfect originality of Hogg
possessed an indescribable attraction and charm which
the other would have fully appreciated. Many years
after this period, Hogg retained a careless brightness of
conversation and joyous manner which were seen in no
other man. The union of the shepherd and the poet
formed a combination as rare and striking as that of the
soldado with the divinity student of Marischal College,
in the person of the renowned Dugald Dalgetty.</p>

<p>One day, after Hogg had been in London—and
‘The Hogg,’ as Lockhart said, ‘was the lion of the
season’—Allan Cunningham chanced to meet James
Smith of the <i>Rejected Addresses</i> at the table of the great
bibliopole, John Murray. ‘How,’ said Smith, aloud, to
Allan, ‘how does Hogg like Scotland’s small cheer after
the luxury of London?’ ‘Small cheer!’ echoed Allan;
‘he has the finest trout in the Yarrow, the finest lambs
on its braes, the finest grouse on its hills, and, besides,
he as good as keeps a <em>sma’ still</em>’ [smuggled whisky].
‘Pray, what better luxury can London offer?’ All
these sumptuosities the Shepherd cheerfully shared with
the wayfarers who flocked to Altrive Cottage.</p>

<p>Another visitor at Abbotsford during the season of
1817, was Lady Byron. ‘I have had the honour,’ says
Laidlaw, ‘of dining in the company of Lady Byron and
Lord Somerville. Her ladyship is a beautiful little
woman with fair hair, a fine complexion, and rather
large blue eyes; face not round. She looked steadily
grave, and seldom smiled. I thought her mouth indicated
great firmness, or rather obstinacy. Miss Anne
Scott and Lady Byron rode to Newark.’ After the date
of this visit by Lady Byron, Laidlaw says he had many
conversations with Scott concerning the life and poetry<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">151</span>
of Byron. ‘He seemed to regret very much that Byron
and he had not been thrown more together. He felt
the influence he had over his great contemporary’s
mind, and said there was so much in it that was very
good and very elevated, that any one whom he much
liked could, as he (Scott) thought, have withdrawn him
from many of his errors.’</p>

<p>All went on smoothly and gaily at Abbotsford. Every
year had added to the beauty of the poet’s domain, and
to the richness of his various collections and library.
His opinion of Gothic architecture is thus expressed:
‘I have got a very good plan from Atkinson for my
addition, but I do not like the outside, which is modern
Gothic, a style I hold to be equally false and foolish.
Blore and I have been at work to <em>Scotify</em> it, by turning
battlements into bartisans, and so on. I think we have
struck out a picturesque, appropriate, and entirely new
line of architecture.’ Abbotsford must certainly be considered
picturesque, but it is a somewhat incongruous,
ill-placed pile; and without the beautiful garden-screen
in front, the general effect would be heavy.</p>

<p>In the Waverley Novels, then appearing in that
marvellously rapid succession which astonished the
world, there was an ample reservoir of wealth, if it had
been wisely secured, as well as of fame. But an alarming
interruption was threatened by the illness of the
novelist. His malady—cramp of the stomach, with
jaundice—was attended with exquisite pain; but in the
intervals of comparative ease his literary labours were
continued; and it certainly is an extraordinary fact in
literary history that under such circumstances the greater
part of the <i>Bride of Lammermoor</i>, the whole of the
<i>Legend of Montrose</i>, and almost the whole of <i>Ivanhoe</i><span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">152</span>
were produced. The novelist lay on a sofa, dictating to
John Ballantyne or to Laidlaw; chiefly to the latter, as
he was always at hand, whereas Ballantyne was only an
occasional visitor at Abbotsford. Sometimes, in his
most humorous or elevated scenes, Scott would break
off with a groan of torture, as the cramp seized him, but
when the visitation had passed, he was ever ready gaily
to take up the broken thread of his narrative and proceed
<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">currente calamo</i>. It was evident to Laidlaw that
before he arrived at Abbotsford (generally about ten
o’clock) the novelist had arranged his scenes for the
day, and settled in his mind the course of the narrative.
The <em>language</em> was left to the inspiration of the moment;
there was no picking of words, no studied <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">curiosa felicitas</i>
of expression. Even the imagery seemed spontaneous.
Laidlaw abjured with some warmth the old-wife exclamations
which Lockhart ascribes to him—as, ‘Gude keep
us a’’—‘The like o’ that!’—‘Eh, sirs! eh, sirs!’ But
he admitted that while he held the pen he was at times
so deeply interested in the scene or in the development
of the plot, that he could not help exclaiming: ‘Get on,
Mr Scott, get on!’ on which the novelist would reply,
smiling: ‘Softly, Willie; you know I have to make the
story,’ or some good-humoured remark of a similar purport.
It was quite true, he said, that when dictating
some of the animated scenes and dialogues in <i>Ivanhoe</i>,
Scott would rise from his seat and act the scene with
every suitable accompaniment of tone, gesture, and
manner. Both the military and dramatic spirit were
strong in him—too strong even for the cramp and
calomel! The postscript to a short business letter from
Edinburgh, June 14, 1819, refers to this business of
dictation. ‘Put your fingers in order, and buy yourself<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">153</span>
pens!—I won’t <em>stand</em> the expense of your quills, so
pluck the goose ’a God’s name!’ And it was plucked
on this occasion to record the sorrows of the Bride of
Lammermoor.</p>

<p>According to Mr Laidlaw, Scott did not like to speak
about his novels after they were published, but was fond
of canvassing the merits and peculiarities of the characters
while he was engaged in the composition of the
story. ‘He was peculiarly anxious,’ says Laidlaw,
‘respecting the success of Rebecca in <i>Ivanhoe</i>. One
morning, as we were walking in the woods after our
forenoon’s labour, I expressed my admiration of the
character, and, after a short pause, he broke out with:
“Well, I think I shall make something of my Jewess.”
Latterly, he seemed to indulge in a retrospect of the
useful effect of his labours. In one of these serious
moods, I remarked that one circumstance of the highest
interest might and ought to yield him very great satisfaction—namely,
that his narratives were the best of all
reading for young people. I had found that even his
friend Miss Edgeworth had not such power in engaging
attention. His novels had the power, beyond any other
writings, of arousing the better passions and finer feelings;
and the moral effect of all this, I added, when one
looks forward to several generations—every one acting
upon another—must be immense. I well recollect the
place where we were walking at this time—on the road
returning from the hill towards Abbotsford. Sir Walter
was silent for a minute or two, but I observed his eyes
filled with tears.... I never saw him much elated or
excited in composition but one morning, out of doors,
when he was composing that simple but humorous song,
<i>Donald Caird</i>. I watched him limping along at good<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">154</span>
five miles an hour along the ridge or sky-line opposite
Kaeside, and when he came in, he recited to me the
fruits of his walk. His memory was an inexhaustible
repertory, so that Hogg, in his moments of super-exaltation
and vanity, used to say that if he had the <em>shirra’s</em>
memory he would beat him as a poet!’</p>

<p>The memory of Sir Walter Scott was vast, but inexact.
In this respect he was inferior to Macaulay or Sir James
Mackintosh. In quoting poetry, Sir Walter was seldom
verbally correct, and sometimes the harmony of the
verse suffered. The two famous lines of Milton’s
<i>Comus</i>:</p>

<div class="poetry-container w20">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indentsq">‘The aery tongues that syllable men’s names,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">On sands, and shores, and desert wildernesses,’</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="in0">are thus given in the <i>Letters on Demonology</i>:</p>

<div class="poetry-container w20">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indentsq">‘The aery tongues that syllable men’s names,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">On shores, in desert sands, and wildernesses.’</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="in0">Thomas Campbell used to relate, as an instance of Sir
Walter’s extraordinary memory, that he read to him his
poem of <i>Locheil’s Warning</i> before it was printed; after
which his friend asked permission to read it himself.
He then perused the manuscript slowly and distinctly,
and on returning it to its author, said: ‘Campbell, look
after your copyright, for I have got your poem.’ And
he repeated, with very few mistakes, the whole sixty
lines of which the poem (which was subsequently
enlarged) then consisted.</p>

<p>Hogg was generally exalted and buoyant enough.
On one occasion we find him writing to Laidlaw: ‘I
rode through the whole of Edinburgh yesterday in a
barouche by myself, having four horses and two postillions!
Never was there a poet went through it before<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">155</span>
in such style since the world began!’ We may exclaim
with Johnson on the amount of Goldsmith’s debts, ‘Was
ever poet so trusted before!’</p>

<p>In the midst of his business details and directions,
Scott’s peculiar humour and felicity of illustration are
perpetually breaking out. Of a neighbouring county
magnate he says: ‘I have heard of a Christian being a
Jew, but our friend is the essence of a whole synagogue.’
His relation of the simplest occurrence is vivid and
characteristic. A high wind in Edinburgh, in January
1818, he thus notices: ‘I had more than an anxious
thought about you all during the gale of wind. The
Gothic pinnacles were blown from the top of Bishop
Sandford’s Episcopal chapel at the end of Princes
Street, and broke through the roof and flooring, doing
great damage. This was sticking the horns of the mitre
into the belly of the church. The devil never so well
deserved the title of Prince of the power of the air,
since he has blown down this handsome church, and
left the ugly mass of new building standing on the
North Bridge.’ One incidental remark illustrates the
deception men often practise on themselves: ‘I have
not,’ he says, ‘a head for accounts, and detest debt.
When I find expense too great, I strike sail, and diminish
future outlay, which is the only principle for careless
accountants to act upon.’ Happy would it have been
for him if his practice had corresponded with his theory!</p>

<p>The year 1820 was, in the family calendar of the
poet, one of peculiar interest and importance. It was
the year in which his eldest daughter was married;
the year in which he received the honour of the
baronetcy; and the year in which he sat to Chantrey
for his bust—that admirable work of art which has made<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">156</span>
his features familiar in every quarter of the globe. He
sat also this year to Sir Thomas Lawrence. ‘The king,’
he writes, ‘has commanded me to sit to Sir Thomas
Lawrence for a portrait, for his most sacred apartment.
I want to have in <i>Maida</i>’ [his favourite deer-hound],
‘that there may be one handsome fellow of the party.’
Late in life, Sir Walter sat to Lawrence Macdonald the
sculptor, and Laidlaw says of the artist and his work:</p>

<p>‘We were much pleased with some days of Macdonald
the sculptor, who modelled Sir Walter while he was
dictating to me. Macdonald’s model was in a higher
style of art than Chantrey’s, and from that cause, had
not so much character. Macdonald confessed this was
not so much his object. It was a faithful likeness,
nevertheless, but not so familiar. For the same reason,
he would not take the exact figure of the head, which
is irregular. Chantrey likewise declined to shew this,
which the phrenologists will probably regret.’</p>

<p>Mr Lawrence Macdonald still lives to delight his
friends, and pursue his art in Rome, where he has long
resided. He has no recollection of the ‘irregularity,’
referred to. Laidlaw knew nothing of art, and by ‘high
style,’ he probably meant an idealised likeness—a look
to ‘elevate and surprise.’ The extreme length of the
upper lip was a personal characteristic of Sir Walter,
which he was glad to see artists reduce, and which none
of the portraits fully represents. It is by no means
uncommon among the stalwart men of the Border,
but is unquestionably a defect as respects personal
appearance. The Stratford bust of Shakspeare, it will
be recollected, has the same long upper lip, as well as
the memorable high forehead, that distinguished Scott.
Of Chantrey, Laidlaw writes:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">157</span></p>

<p>‘I met at breakfast Chantrey the sculptor, a real
blunt, spirited, fine Yorkshireman, with great good-humour,
and an energy of character about him that
would have made his fortune—and a great one—had
he gone to London as a tailor. He killed a fine salmon
in the Tweed, and led another a long time, but let it
go among the great stones and cut his line. Colonel
Ferguson said he believed he would rather have given
his best statue than lost the fish.’</p>

<p>Chantrey was an enthusiastic angler.</p>

<p>The baronetcy was a step of rank which Sir Walter
said was the king’s own free motion, and none of his
seeking. To a lady whom he highly esteemed—the
late Hon. Mrs Stewart Mackenzie of Seaforth—he
wrote:</p>

<p>‘The circumstance of my children being heirs to their
uncle’s fortune, relieved me in a great degree of the
chief objection to accepting with gratitude what was so
graciously offered, namely, that which arose from a more
limited income than becomes even the lowest step of
hereditary rank.... Mr Lockhart, to whom Sophia
is now married, is the husband of her choice. He is
a man of excellent talents, master of his pen and of his
pencil, handsome in person, and well-mannered, though
wanting that ease which the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">usage du monde</i> alone can
give. I like him very much; for having no son who
promises to take a literary turn, it is of importance to
me, both in point of comfort and otherwise, to have
some such intimate friend and relation, whose pursuits
and habits are similar to my own—so that, upon the
whole, I trust I have gained a son instead of losing a
daughter.’<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">10</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">158</span></p>

<p>Early next year (1821), Scott was in London, and on
February 16, took place the unfortunate duel, in which
John Scott, editor of the <i>London Magazine</i>, fell. The
antagonist of John Scott was Mr Christie, a barrister,
the friend of Lockhart. ‘I have had much to plague
me here,’ writes Sir Walter, ‘besides the death of John
Scott, who departed last night; so much for being slow
to take the field!’ And in another letter he recurs to
the subject: ‘The death of my unlucky namesake, John
Scott, you will have heard of. The poor man fought
a most unnecessary duel to regain his lost character,
and so lost his life into the bargain.’ The loss of life
was chiefly owing to the blundering of John Scott’s
second in the duel, who permitted a second fire to take
place after Mr Christie had discharged his pistol down
the field.</p>

<p>The visit of King George IV. to Scotland in 1822,
was an event sure to call forth the enthusiastic loyalty
of Sir Walter. His Majesty’s personal attentions, besides
the distinction of the baronetcy, elicited his warmest
gratitude, and, in addition, all his fervid nationality and
veneration for the throne were kindled on this occasion.
To see the king in the ancient palace of Holyrood, was
itself an incident like the realisation of a dream. The
whole city was in a state of frantic excitement: ‘Edinburgh
is irrecoverably mad,’ said Scott. To Laidlaw,
the chivalrous poet writes:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>‘<span class="smcap">Dear Willie</span>—You are quite right in your opinion
of Saunders. He never shewed himself a more true-blooded
gentleman. The extreme tact and taste of all
ranks has surprised the king and all about him. No
rushing or roaring, but a devoted attachment, expressed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">159</span>
by a sort of dignified reverence, which seemed divided
betwixt a high veneration for their sovereign and a
suitable regard for themselves. I have seen in my day
many a levee and drawing-room, but none so august
and free from absurdity and ridicule as those of Holyrood.
The apartments also, desolate and stripped as
they have been, are worth a hundred of Carlton or
Buckingham House; but the singular and native good-breeding
of the people, who never saw a court, is the
most remarkable of all. The populace without, shew
the same propriety as the gentles within. The people
that our carriages passed amongst to-day were all full
of feeling, and it was remarkable that, instead of
huzzaing, they shewed the singular compliment of lifting
up their children to see them—the most affecting thing
you ever witnessed. When Saunders goes wrong, it
must be from <i xml:lang="it" lang="it">malice prepense</i>; for no one knows so well
how to do right. Mamma (Lady Scott), Sophia, and
Anne were dreadfully frightened, and I, of course,
though an old courtier, in such a court as Holyrood,
was a good deal uneasy. The king, however, spoke to
them, and they were all kissed in due form, though they
protest they are still at a loss how the ceremony was
performed. The king leaves on Wednesday, to my great
joy, for strong emotions cannot last. He has lived
entirely within doors. To-morrow, I suppose, there is
a dinner-party at Dalkeith, as I am commanded there,
but it is the first. I have had, from over-exertion and
distress of mind, a strong cutaneous eruption in my
legs and arms. You would think I had adopted the
national musical instrument to regale his Majesty; but,
seriously, I believe I should have been ill but for the
relief Nature has been pleased to afford me in this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">160</span>
ungainly way. Fortunately, my hands and face are
clear.</p>

<p class="right">
W. S.’
</p>
</div>

<p>And Laidlaw, writing to a friend, gives some further
particulars:</p>

<p>‘Sir Walter was very full of the king for a while, but
we went up Ettrick, and I have seen but little of him
since. He had serious work with the English noblemen
in the king’s train, who did not seem to wish that Scotland
should shew off as an independent kingdom, which,
by the articles of the Union, was provided for in the
event of the king’s coming to Edinburgh. They wanted
all to be done according to English form, as was the
case in Ireland, but he settled them. They proposed,
too, that the Highland guard (indeed they objected to
the guard altogether) should have the flints taken from
their pistols! A deputy, Colonel Stevenson, had the
management, and corresponded with Sir Walter; and as
he was to dine at Castle Street with a number of the
Highland chiefs, Sir Walter proposed that the colonel
should speak to them on the subject. After they were
a little warmed with wine, Sir Walter addressed Stevenson,
who sat beside him, saying he had better now propose
what he had mentioned before. The Highlanders
had got to telling old stories, and were in high spirits;
they were, of course, in full dress. Colonel Stevenson
said he saw now that he had mistaken the sort of people
beside him; and on Sir Walter pressing him (rather
slyly) to proceed, he declared he would rather not.</p>

<p>‘The king was greatly surprised and affected with the
behaviour of the people on Sunday. They did not
cheer as usual, but took off their hats and bowed as
they passed along. He expressed himself strongly to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">161</span>
Sir Walter about this. Sir Walter said the verses of the
cavalier to his mistress might be applied to the people:</p>

<div class="poetry-container w18">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indentq">“Yet this inconstancy is such</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">As you too shall adore;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I could not love thee, dear, so much,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Loved I not honour more.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="in0">I found the lines were by Lovelace, addressed to his
Lucasta, on his going to the wars. The king witnessed
an incident that seemed, as Sir Walter said, to have
made a deep impression on his mind. As he came
along the Calton Hill road, the crowd made a rush down
hill towards the royal carriage, and the king saw a child
fall. Had it been in London, he said, the child would
have been trampled to death, and he expected nothing
else. But in a moment there was a loud cry of “Stop!”
and five or six men linked themselves together arm-in-arm,
and set themselves to keep off the crowd, standing
like an arch; then a man stepped before them and lifted
the boy, and held him up above the crowd, to shew that
he was not hurt. Sir Walter heard the king relate this
incident twice.’</p>

<p>In the autumn of 1825, Sir Walter visited Ireland,
and thus, in homely confidential style, records his
impressions:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>‘<span class="smcap">My dear Willie</span>—I conclude you are now returned,
with wife and bairns, to Kaeside, and not the worse of
your tour. I have been the better of mine; and Killarney
being the extreme point, I am just about to
commence my return to Dublin, where I only intend
to remain two or three days at farthest. I should like
to find a line from you, addressed “Care of David
Macculloch, Esq., Cheltenham,” letting me know how<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">162</span>
matters go on at Abbotsford—if you want money (as I
suppose you do), and so forth.</p>

<p>‘I have every reason to make a good report of
Ireland, having been received with distinction, which
is flattering, and with warm-hearted kindness, which is
much better. I am happy to say the country is rapidly
improving every year, which argues the spirit that is
afloat, and indicates that British capital is finding its
way into a country where it can be employed to advantage.
The idea of security is gaining ground even in
those districts which are, or rather were, the most
unsettled, and plenty has brought her usual companion
content, in her hand. But the public peace is secured
chiefly by large bodies of armed police, called by the
civil term of constables, but very unlike the Dogberries
of England, being, in fact, soldiers on foot and horse,
well armed and mounted, and dressed exactly like our
yeomen. It is not pleasant to see this, but it is
absolutely necessary for some time at least; and from
all I can hear, the men are under strict discipline, and
behave well. They are commanded by the magistracy,
and are very alert.</p>

<p>‘The soil is in most places extremely rich, but cultivation
is not as yet well understood. That accursed
system of making peats interferes with everything; and
I have passed through whole counties where a very
noble harvest, ripe for the sickle, was waiting for the
next shower of rain; while all the population who should
cut were up to the midst in bogs. Not a single field
of turnips have I seen, owing probably to the same
reason.</p>

<p>‘The political disputes are of far less consequence
here than we think in Britain; but, on the whole, it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">163</span>
would be highly desirable that the Catholic Bill should
pass. It would satisfy most of the higher classes of
that persuasion, who seem much inclined to form a sort
of Low Church, differing in ceremonies more than in
essential points from that of the English Church. I
mean they would do this tacitly and gradually. The
lower class will probably continue for a long time bigoted
Papists; but education becoming general, it is to be
supposed that popery, in its violent tenets, will decline
even amongst them. By the way, education is already
far more general than in England. I saw in the same
village four hundred Catholic children attending school,
and about two hundred Protestants attending another.
The peculiar doctrines of neither church were permitted
to be taught; and there were Protestants amongst the
Papist children, and Papists among the Protestant.</p>

<p>‘The general condition of the peasantry requires
much improvement. Their cabins are wretched, and
their dress such a labyrinth of rags, that I have often
feared some button would give way, and shame us all.
But this is mending, and the younger people are all
more decently dressed, and the new huts which are
arising are greatly better than the old pigsties. In
short, all is on the move and the mend. But as I must
be on the move myself, I must defer the rest of my
discoveries till we meet. We have in our party, Anne,
Lockhart, Walter and his wife, and two Miss Edgeworths,
so we are a jolly party. Will you shew this to
Lady Scott? I wrote to her two days since.—Always
truly yours,</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">Walter Scott</span>.
</p>

<p>‘<span class="smcap">Killarney</span>, <i>8th August</i>.’</p>
</div>

<p>The brilliance of Abbotsford had now reached its<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">164</span>
culminating point. The commercial crisis of 1825–26
was close at hand, and the first note of the alarm and
confusion in the money-market suspended all improvements,
and occasioned intense anxiety to Sir Walter.
We add two letters as supplementing Lockhart’s narrative:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>‘<span class="smcap">My dear William</span>—The money-market in London
is in a tremendous state, so much so that, whatever
good reason I have, and I have the best, for knowing
that Constable and his allies, Hurst and Robinson, are
in perfect force, yet I hold it wise and necessary to
prepare myself for making good my engagements, which
come back on me suddenly, or by taking up those
which I hold good security for. For this purpose I
have resolved to exercise my reserved faculty to burden
Abbotsford with £8000 or £10,000. I can easily get
the money, and having no other debts, and these well
secured, I hold it better to “put money in my purse,”
and be a debtor on my land for a year or two, till
the credit of the public is restored. I may not want
the money, in which case I will buy into the funds,
and make some cash by it. But I think it would
be most necessary, and even improper not to be fully
prepared.</p>

<p>‘What I want of you is to give me a copy of the
rental of Abbotsford, as it now stands, mentioning the
actual rents of ground let, and the probable rents of
those in my hand. You gave me one last year, but I
would rather have the actual rents, and as such business
is express, I would have you send it immediately, and
keep it all as much within as you think fair and prudent.
Your letter need only contain the rental, and you may<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">165</span>
write your remarks separately. I have not the slightest
idea of losing a penny, but the distrust is so great in
London that the best houses refuse the best bills of the
best tradesmen, and as I have retained such a sum in
view of protecting my literary commerce, I think it
better to make use of it, and keep my own mind easy,
than to carry about bills to unwilling banks, and beg
for funds which I can use of my own. I have more
than £10,000 to receive before Midsummer, but then
I might be put to vexation before that, which I am
determined to prevent.</p>

<p>‘By all I can learn, this is just such an embarrassment
as may arise when pickpockets cry “Fire!” in a crowd,
and honest men get trampled to death. Thank God, I
can clear myself of the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">mêlée</i>, and am not afraid of the
slightest injury. If the money horizon does not clear
up in a month or two, I will abridge my farming, &amp;c.
I cannot find there is any real cause for this; but an
imaginary one will do equal mischief. I need not say
this is confidential.—Yours truly,</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">Walter Scott</span>.
</p>

<p>‘<i>16th December</i> [1825], <span class="smcap">Edinburgh</span>.’</p>
</div>

<p>‘The confusion of 1814 is a joke to this. I have no
debts of my own. On the contrary, £3000 and more
lying out on interest, &amp;c. It is a little hard that,
making about £7000 a year, and working hard for it,
I should have this botheration. But it arises out of the
nature of the same connection which gives, and has
given me, a fortune, and therefore I am not entitled to
grumble.’</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="right">
[<span class="smcap">Edinburgh</span>, <i>January 26, 1826</i>.]
</p>

<p>‘<span class="smcap">My dear Willie</span>—I wrote to you some days since,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">166</span>
but from yours by the carrier I see my letter has not
reached you. It does not much signify, as it was not,
and could not be, of any great consequence until I see
how these untoward matters are to turn up. Of course,
everything will depend on the way the friends of the
great house in London, and those of Constable here,
shall turn out. Were they to be ultimately good, or
near it, this would pass over my head with little inconvenience.
But I think it better to take the worst point
of view, and suppose that I do not receive from them
above five shillings in the pound; and even in that case,
I am able to make a proposal to my creditors, that if
they allow me to put my affairs into the hands of a
private trustee, or trustees, and finish the literary engagements
I have on hand, there is no great chance of their
being ultimate losers. This is the course I should
choose. But if they wish rather to do what they can
for themselves, they will, in that case, give me a great
deal of pain, and make a great deal less of the funds.
For, it is needless to say, that no security can make a
man write books, and upon my doing so—I mean completing
those in hand—depends the instant payment of
a large sum. I have no reason to apprehend that any
of the parties concerned are blind to their interest in
this matter. I have had messages from all the banks,
&amp;c., offering what assistance they could give, so that I
think my offer will be accepted. Indeed, as they cannot
sell Abbotsford, owing to its being settled in Walter’s
marriage contract, there can be little doubt they will
adopt the only way which promises, with a little time, to
give them full payment, and my life may, in the meanwhile,
be insured. My present occupations completed,
will enable me to lay down, in the course of the summer,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">167</span>
at least £20,000 of good cash, which, if things had
remained sound among the booksellers, would have put
me on velvet.</p>

<p>‘The probable result being that we must be accommodated
with the delay necessary, our plan is to sell
the house and furniture in Castle Street, and Lady S.
and Anne to come to Abbotsford, with a view of economising,
while I take lodgings in Edinburgh, and work
hard till the Session permits me to come out. All our
farming operations must, of course, be stopped so soon
as they can with least possible loss, and stock, &amp;c.,
disposed of. In short, everything must be done to
avoid outlay. At the same time, there can be no want
of comfort. I must keep Peter and the horses for Lady
Scott’s sake, though I make sacrifices in my own [case].
Bogie, I think, we will also keep, but we must sell the
produce of the garden. As for Tom, he and I go to
the grave together. All idle horses, &amp;c., must be
dispensed with.</p>

<p>‘For you, my dear friend, we must part—that is, as
laird and factor—and it rejoices me to think that your
patience and endurance, which set me so good an
example, are like to bring round better days. You
never flattered my prosperity, and in my adversity it is
not the least painful consideration that I cannot any
longer be useful to you. But Kaeside, I hope, will still
be your residence; and I will have the advantage of
your company and advice, and probably your services
as amanuensis. Observe, I am not in indigence, though
no longer in affluence; and if I am to exert myself in
the common behalf, I must have honourable and easy
means of life, although it will be my inclination to
observe the most strict privacy, both to save expense<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">168</span>
and also time; nor do we propose to see any one but
yourself and the Fergusons.</p>

<p>‘I will be obliged to you to think over all these
matters; also whether anything could be done in leasing
the saw-mill, or Swanston working it for the public. I
should like to keep him if I could. I imagine they
must leave me my official income, which, indeed, is not
liable to be attached. That will be £1600 a year, but
there is Charles’s college expenses come to £300 at
least. I can add, however, £200 or £300 without
interrupting serious work. Three or four years of my
favour with the public, if my health and life permit, will
make me better off than ever I have been in my life.
I hope it will not inconvenience the Miss Smiths to be
out of their money for a little while. It is a most
unexpected chance on my part.</p>

<p>‘All that I have said is for your consideration and
making up your mind, for nothing can be certain till
we hear what the persons principally concerned please
to say. But then, if they accede to the trust, we will
expect to have the pleasure of seeing you here with a
list of stock and a scheme of what you think best to be
done. My purpose is that everything shall be paid
ready money from week to week.</p>

<p>‘I have £180 to send to you, and it is in my hands.
Of course it will be paid, but I am unwilling to send it
until I know the exact footing on which I am to stand.
The gentleman whom I wish should be my trustee—or
one of them—is John Gibson, the Duke’s factor.</p>

<p>‘Lady Scott’s spirits were affected at first, but she is
getting better. For myself, I feel like the Eildon Hills—quite
firm, though a little cloudy. I do not dislike
the path which lies before me. I have seen all that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">169</span>
society can shew, and enjoyed all that wealth can give
me, and I am satisfied much is vanity, if not vexation
of spirit. I am arranging my affairs, and mean to
economise a good deal, and I will pay every man his
due.—Yours truly,</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">Walter Scott</span>.’
</p>
</div>

<p>There was some delusion in all this. Sir Walter never
fully comprehended the state of his pecuniary affairs.
It was one of his weaknesses, as James Ballantyne has
said, to shrink too much from looking evil in the face,
and he was apt to carry a great deal too far ‘sufficient
for the day is the evil thereof.’ Laidlaw mentions
another small weakness: ‘he was always in alarm lest
the servants should suspect he was in want of money.’
This, of course, was subsequent to the public declaration
of the failure. Laidlaw went to Edinburgh to report to
the trustees with respect to the best way of closing the
farm business, and there met Sir Walter.</p>

<p>‘He bears himself wonderfully. Miss Scott does not
seem to be quite aware or sensible of anything but that
they are to reside in retirement at Abbotsford. Lady
Scott is rather unwilling to believe it, and does not see
the necessity of such complete retrenchment as Sir
Walter tells her is absolutely necessary. I have dined
three times there, and there is not much difference in
their manner. Sir W. is often merry, and so are they
all, but still oftener silent. I think that if they were a
week or two at Abbotsford they would be more happy
than they have been for many a day. I am sure this
would be the case with Sir Walter, for the weight of
such an immense system of bills sent for his signature
every now and then would be off his mind. I heard to-day
that the Duke of Somerset and another English<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">170</span>
nobleman have written to Sir Walter, offering him
£30,000 each, which he has firmly refused; and it is
reported that the young Duke of Buccleuch has written
him, offering to take the whole loss on himself, and to
pay the interest of Sir Walter’s debt until he comes of
age. If that is true, Sir Walter should accept the offer
for the Duke’s own sake—for the glorious moral effect
it would have upon the truly noble young fellow. But,
apart from all this, cannot they set up Constable again?
He has likewise been a real benefactor to his country,
and then Sir Walter would, of course, be relieved.’</p>

<p>The private grief of Scott was for a short time merged
in what he considered an important public cause. The
Liverpool Administration at this time proposed to
change the Scotch system of currency, abolishing the
small bank-notes, and assimilating the monetary system
of Scotland to that of England. This project was
assailed by the wit, humour, sound sense, and nationality
of Scott, in a series of letters signed ‘Malachi Malagrowther,’
and the letters of Malachi were as successful
as those of Swift’s ‘M. B. Drapier’ concerning the
currency of Ireland. The English government, in both
cases, was compelled to abandon the denationalising
scheme. Scott writes to Laidlaw, March 1, 1826:</p>

<p>‘I enclose a couple of copies of a pamphlet on the
currency, which may amuse you. The other copy is
for Mr Craig, Galashiels. I have got off some bile from
my stomach which has been disturbing me for some
years. The Scotch have a fair opportunity now to give
battle, if they dare avail themselves of it. One would
think I had little to do, that I should go loose upon
politics.’</p>

<p>He had, in fact, entered upon his herculean task of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">171</span>
paying off some £120,000 of debt by his pen! The
<i>Life of Napoleon</i> was commenced, and in the autumn
the biographer set off for London and Paris to consult
state-papers and gather information. He succeeded
well in his errand. ‘My collection of information,’ he
writes, ‘goes on faster than I can take it in; but, then,
it is so much coloured by passion and party-feeling, that
it requires much scouring. I spent a day at the Royal
Lodge at Windsor, which was a grand affair for John
Nicholson, as he got an opportunity to see his Majesty.’
And the incident, no doubt, afforded as much gratification
to the kind, indulgent master as it did to the
servant.</p>

<p>After the Abbotsford establishment was broken up,
Laidlaw was some time engaged in cataloguing the large
library of Scott of Harden, and at times visiting his
brothers, sheep-farmers in Ross-shire. The following
description of a scene he witnessed, a Highland Summer
Sacrament out of doors, evinces no mean powers of
observation and description:</p>

<p>‘The people here gather in thousands to the sacraments,
as they did in Ettrick in Boston’s time. We set
out on Sunday to the communion at Ferrintosh, near
Dingwall, to which the people resort from fifty miles’
distance. Macdonald, the minister who attracts this
concourse of persons, was the son of a piper in Caithness
(but from the Celtic population of the mountains
there). He preached the sermon in the church in
English, with a command of language and a justness of
tone, action, and reasoning—keeping close to the pure
metaphysics of Calvin—that I have seldom, if ever,
heard surpassed. He had great energy on all points,
but it never touched on extravagance. The Highland<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">172</span>
congregation sat in a <em>cleugh</em>, or dell, of a long, hollow,
oval shape, bordered with hazel and birch and wild roses.
It seemed to be formed for the purpose. We
walked round the outside of the congregated thousands,
and looked down on the glen from the upper end, and
the scene was really indescribable. Two-thirds of those
present were women, dressed mostly in large, high,
wide muslin caps, the back part standing up like the
head of a paper kite, and ornamented with ribbons.
They had wrapped round them bright-coloured plaid
shawls, the predominant hue being scarlet.</p>

<p>‘It was a warm, breezy day, one of the most glorious
in June. The place will be about half a mile from the
Frith on the south side, and at an elevation of five
hundred feet. Dingwall was just opposite at the foot of
Ben Wyvis, still spotted with wreaths of snow. Over
the town, with its modern castle, its church, and
Lombardy poplars, we saw up the richly cultivated
valley of Strathpeffer. The tufted rocks and woods of
Brahan (Mackenzie of Seaforth) were a few miles to the
south, and fields of wheat and potatoes, separated with
hedgerows of trees, intervened. Further off, the high-peaked
mountains that divide the county of Inverness
from Ross-shire towered in the distance. I never saw
such a scene. We sat down on the brae among the
people, the long white communion tables being conspicuous
at the bottom. The congregation began
singing the psalm to one of the plaintive, wild old tunes
that I am told are only sung in the Gaelic service. The
people all sing, but in such an extended multitude they
could not sing all together. They chanted, as it were,
in masses or large groups. I can compare the singing
to nothing earthly, except it be imagining what would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">173</span>
be the effect of a gigantic and tremendous Æolian harp
with hundreds of strings! There was no resisting the
impression. After coming a little to myself, I went and
paced the length and breadth of the amphitheatre,
taking averages, and carefully noting, as well as I could,
how the people were sitting together, and I could not,
in this way, make them less than 9500, besides those in
the church, amounting perhaps to 1500. Most of the
gentlemen of the neighbourhood, with their families,
were there. I enjoyed the scene as something perfect in
its way, and of rare beauty and excellence—like Melrose
Abbey under a fine light, or the back of old Edinburgh
during an illumination, or the Loch of the Lowes in a
fine calm July evening, five minutes after sunset!’</p>

<p>The following brief and pleasant note, without date,
must be referred to 1827, as it was in June of that year
that the <i>Life of Napoleon</i> was published:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>‘<span class="smcap">My dear Mr Laidlaw</span>—I would be happy if you
would come down at <em>kail-time</em> to-day. <i>Napoleon</i> (6000
copies) is sold for £11,000.—Yours truly,</p>

<p class="right">
W. S.
</p>

<p>‘<i>Sunday.</i>’</p>
</div>

<p>Mr Gibson, W.S., in his <i>Reminiscences of Sir Walter
Scott</i> (1871), says of the transactions of this period:
‘Of <i>Woodstock</i>, 9850 copies were sold for £9500; and
of the <i>Life of Napoleon</i>, 8000 copies were sold for
£18,200, and these sums, with some other funds
realised, were speedily divided amongst the creditors.’
Under the date of August 1827, Sir Walter writes in the
following affectionate strain:</p>

<p>‘Your leaving Kaeside makes a most melancholy
blank to us. You, Mrs Laidlaw, and the bairns, were
objects we met with so much pleasure, that it is painful<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">174</span>
to think of strangers being there. But they do not
deserve good weather who cannot endure the bad, and
so I would “set a stout heart to a stey” [steep] “brae;”
yet I think the loss of our walks, plans, discussions,
and debates, does not make the least privation that I
experience from the loss of world’s gear. But, <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">sursum
corda</i>, and we shall have many happy days yet, and
spend some of them together. I expect Walter and
Jane, and then our long-separated family will be all
together in peace and happiness. I hope Mrs Laidlaw
and you will come down and spend a few days with us,
and revisit your old haunts. I miss you terribly at this
moment, being engaged in writing a planting article for
the <i>Quarterly</i>, and not having patience to make some
necessary calculations.’</p>

<p>Mr Laidlaw has written on the back of the communication:
‘This letter lies in the drawer in which the
unfinished manuscript of <i>Waverley</i> was found, amongst
fishing-tackle, &amp;c. which yet remain. I got the desk as
a present from Sir Walter.’</p>

<p>The death, in the autumn of 1829, of faithful Tom
Purdie—forester, henchman, and humble friend—was a
heavy blow to Sir Walter, then fast sinking in vigour
and alacrity. The proverbial difficulty of obtaining a
precisely exact account of any contemporary event, even
from parties most closely connected with it, is illustrated
in this case. Lockhart reports the death as follows:</p>

<p>‘Thomas Purdie leaned his head one evening on the
table, and dropped asleep. This was nothing uncommon
in a hard-working man; and his family went and came
about him for several hours, without taking any notice.
When supper came, they tried to awaken him, and found
that life had been for some time extinct.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">175</span></p>

<p>Scott’s account is different:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>‘<span class="smcap">My dear Willie</span>—I write to tell you the shocking
news of poor Tom Purdie’s death, by which I have been
greatly affected. He had complained, or rather spoken,
of a sore throat; and the day before yesterday, as it
came on a shower of rain, I wanted him to walk fast on
to Abbotsford before me, but you know well how
impossible that was. He took some jelly, or trifle of
that kind, but made no complaint. This morning he
rose from bed as usual, and sat down by the table with
his head on his hand; and when his daughter spoke to
him, life had passed away without a sigh or groan.
Poor fellow! There is a heart cold that loved me well,
and, I am sure, thought of my interest more than his
own. I have seldom been so much shocked. I wish
you would take a ride down and pass the night. There
is much I have to say, and this loss adds to my wish to
see you. We dine at four. The day is indifferent, but
the sooner the better.—Yours very truly,</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">Walter Scott</span>.
</p>

<p>‘<span class="smcap">Abbotsford</span>, <i>31st October</i>.’</p>
</div>

<p>A few days afterwards (November 5), Laidlaw thus
relates the story:</p>

<p>‘Tom Purdie, poor fellow! died on Friday night or
Saturday morning. He had fallen asleep with his head
on his hands resting on the table, his usual practice.
Margaret and Mary’ [his wife and daughter] ‘left him
to go to bed when he should awaken; and Margaret
found him exactly in the same situation when she rose,
but dead, cold, and stiff. Sir Walter wrote to me, in
great distress, to come down. I did so on Sunday, and
on Tuesday I went to poor Tom’s funeral. Sir Walter<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">176</span>
had my pony put in again, and made me stay all day.
He was in very great distress about Tom, and will miss
him continually, and in many ways that come nearest to
him. Sir Walter wants us to return to Kaeside at Whitsunday.
<em>Kindness of heart is positively the reigning
quality of Sir Walter’s character!</em>’</p>

<p>A noble eulogium, and pronounced by one better
qualified, perhaps, than any of his contemporaries, to
form the opinion so expressed. Of the greatest author
of his age it might truly be said:</p>

<div class="poetry-container w18">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">‘His highest honours to the heart belong.’</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>William Laidlaw <em>did</em> return to Kaeside. At Whitsuntide
1830, he dropped anchor safely at his old roadstead,
which had been suitably prepared for his reception.
But before doing so, we find him putting in a kind word
for the Ettrick Shepherd, who was in difficulties. In
March 1830, Laidlaw wrote to Sir Walter:</p>

<p>‘I had your letter from Bowhill, and was much
gratified to learn that you and Miss Scott had passed
so much time with the duke and duchess. I have no
doubt that His Grace would bring our friend the Shepherd
and his concerns before you, and I am anxious to
know if it is the duke’s intention to render him a little
more comfortable at Altrive. You know that Hogg
built the cottage there, at his own expense (with an
allowance of wood, perhaps), and he likewise built a
considerable addition to Mount Benger, and a barn—all
which cost him a great sum of money, quite disproportionate
to a holding of £7 a year, even at a
nominal rent. The cottage was intended for a
bachelor’s abode, and is very inadequate to what is now
required by the bard’s family; and I see that if His<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">177</span>
Grace does not think of giving him some allowance as
an addition, it will most likely banish him from the
district with which his poetry and feeling are so closely
associated. I mention all this because I have observed
that there is a prejudice against him among the sub-agents
since Christie left the service, or rather, since the
late duke’s death. One of them said to me, when I
mentioned Hogg’s genius and amiable character, <i xml:lang="it" lang="it">Cui
bono?</i> I, too, say, <i xml:lang="it" lang="it">Cui bono?</i> What is the use of all his
poetry, and the rest? Now, from R.’s usage of him,
there is every reason to suspect that he is a <i xml:lang="it" lang="it">cui bono</i>
man too, and Hogg stands a bad chance among them,
and I believe the duke knows nothing about the truth
of the matter.’</p>

<p>Nothing was done. ‘As to the success of an application
to the duke,’ writes Scott, ‘I am doubtful. The
duke seemed to have made up his mind on the subject,
and I saw no chance of being of service.’ Literature
and the journey to London did something for the
Shepherd. He wrote and struggled on at Altrive till
November 1835, when the ‘world’s poor strife’ was
over, and he sank to rest.</p>

<p>Among the dearest and most valued of all the visitors
at Abbotsford were the Fergusons of Huntly Burn.
Here is a kindly note sent to Kaeside:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>‘Miss Ferrier is to be at Abbotsford this day, being
Tuesday, 20th October’ [1829], ‘and Mr Wilkie is to be
there on Thursday; so, if you come, you will have
painting, poetry, history, and music—as Miss Wilkie is
a musician. In short, all the Muses will be there. If
this does not tempt you, I don’t know what will.—Yours
truly,</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">Isabella Ferguson</span>.’
</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">178</span></p>

<p>Ill-health and political agitation brought darker days
to Abbotsford. The Reform Bill was Sir Walter’s <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">bête
noire</i>. The neighbouring Tory lairds, proud of his
co-operation, induced him to join in their local movement
against the bill, and this still further aggravated
his morbid feeling. In March 1831, he was present at
a meeting of the freeholders of Roxburgh, held at
Jedburgh, to pass resolutions against the Reform Bill.
He was dragged to the meeting by the young Duke
of Buccleuch and Mr Henry Scott of Harden, contrary
to his prior resolution, and his promise to Miss Scott;
for his health was then much shattered. ‘He made a
confused imaginative speech,’ says Laidlaw, ‘which was
full of evil forebodings and mistaken views. The
people who were auditors, in proportion to their love
and reverence for him, felt disappointed and sore, and,
like himself, were carried away by their temporary
chagrin, to the great regret of the country around.’ At
the election in Jedburgh, Sir Walter was hooted at, and
hissed, and saluted with cries of ‘Burke Sir Walter!’
Laidlaw adds: ‘The same people, a few weeks afterwards,
when Mr Oliver, the sheriff of Roxburgh, was
foolishly swearing in constables at Melrose, said boldly
they need not bring them to fight against reform, for
they would fight for it; but if any one meddled with Sir
Walter Scott, they would fight for him.’ Amidst all the
excitement of politics, and in sinking health, Sir Walter
continued to write, or rather to dictate, and worked
steadily at his novel of <i>Count Robert of Paris</i>.</p>

<p>‘I am now writing as amanuensis for Sir Walter,’
said Laidlaw; ‘and have the satisfaction of finding that
I am of essential service to him, as he was attacked
with chilblains on his hands to such a degree as to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">179</span>
unfit him for writing long unless with great pain. We
go on with almost as great spirit as when he dictated
<i>Ivanhoe</i>. He has become a good deal lamer, which
prevents him from taking his usual walks; and he gets
upon a pony with great difficulty. But of late he has
been in excellent spirits. His memory seems to be as
good as ever; at least, it is far beyond that of other
people. I come down at seven o’clock, and write until
nine; we are at it again before ten, and continue
until one. He is impatient and miserable when not
employed.’</p>

<p>About this time—the spring of 1831—Joanna Baillie
published a thin volume of selections from the New
Testament ‘regarding the nature and dignity of Jesus
Christ.’ The tendency of the work was Socinian, or at
least Arian; and Scott was indignant that his friend
should have meddled with such a subject. ‘What had
<em>she</em> to do with questions of that sort?’ He refused to
add the book to his library, and gave it to Laidlaw.
One day Sir Walter was loud in praise of one of the
workmen engaged at Abbotsford, a native of the neighbouring
village of Darnick. ‘Yes,’ added Laidlaw;
‘and do you know, Sir Walter, he is an excellent Burgher
preacher.’<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">11</a> ‘A preacher, d—n him!’ exclaimed Scott
jocularly, and wheeling round as if to whistle the
Burgher preacher down the wind.</p>

<p>In a very manly and interesting letter, addressed to
Lockhart (of which he had kept a copy), Laidlaw enters
into further particulars concerning the studies at Abbotsford:</p>

<p>‘Sir Walter is very greatly better. He has given up<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">180</span>
smoking, and takes porridge to his supper instead of
the long and hearty pull of brown stout. He is full
of jokes and glee. Were it possible to prevail upon
him to wear a greatcoat when he rides out to the hills
in a north-west wind, and to take champagne and water
instead of a monstrous tumbler of strong ale after tea, I
am positive—and so are the regular medical people—that
he would get right again. He drinks no wine, and
has been advised to take gin-toddy instead of whisky.
He has given up the regular dram out of a <em>quaich</em>, but
takes a sly taste of the excellent hollands before he
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">coups</i> it into the tumbler, thereby satisfying his conscience,
no doubt, by reducing it to the half-glass which,
it seems, is the Abercromby law as to strong liquors.
Don’t you mind the style of his letters; that is all, or
nearly all, humbug. What he dictates of <i>Robert of
Paris</i> is, much of it, as good as anything he ever wrote.
He does not go on so fast; but I do not see that he is
much more apt to make blunders—that is, to let his
imagination get ahead of his speech—than when he wrote
<i>Ivanhoe</i>. The worst business was that accursed nonsensical
petition in the name of the magistrates, justices
of the peace, and freeholders of the extensive, influential,
and populous county of Selkirk! We were more than
three days at it. At the beginning of the third day, he
walked backwards and forwards, enunciating the half-sentences
with a deep and awful voice, his eyebrows
seemingly more shaggy than ever, and his eyes more
fierce and glaring—altogether, like the royal beast in
his cage! It suddenly came over me, as politics was
always Sir Walter’s weak point, that he was crazy, and
that I should have to come down to Abbotsford, and
write on and away at the petition until the crack of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">181</span>
doom! I was seized at the same moment with an
inclination, almost uncontrollable, to burst into laughter.
But seriously, you know, as well as anybody, his great
excitability on political matters; and I must say it
surprised me not a little that a person of your sagacity
and acuteness should have thought of writing him upon
politics at all, the more, because I believe that if a
magpie were to come and chatter politics, or even that
body, Lord M., he would believe all they said, if they
spoke of change, and danger, and rumours of war—<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">belli
servilis</i> more than all. (May I speak and live!) I felt
inclined to doubt whether you had not <em>gane gyte</em>’ [gone
crazy] ‘yourself! Could you not have sent him literary
chit-chat and amusing anecdotes from London, which
would have been the very thing for him, as it was of
great consequence that his mind should be kept calm
and cheerful?’</p>

<p>Mental disease and physical infirmity continued to
increase, and a winter at Naples, with complete abstinence
from literary labour, was prescribed. Wordsworth
prayed for favouring gales:</p>

<div class="poetry-container w18">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent20">‘Be true,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Ye winds of ocean, and the midland sea,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Wafting your charge to soft Parthenope!’</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Alas! it was all in vain. Before quitting the country,
Sir Walter gave Laidlaw a mandate, or letter of authority,
to represent him at county meetings, and a paper of
directions as to keeping the house, the books, and
garden in order. Two items are worth quoting as
characteristic:</p>

<p>‘The dogs to be taken care of, especially to shut
them up separately when there is anything to quarrel
about.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">182</span></p>

<p>‘When Mr Laidlaw thinks it will be well taken, to
consult Mr Nicol Milne, and not to stop young Mr
Nicol when shooting on our side of the hedge.’</p>

<p>Having made these arrangements, the invalid thought
of taking a farewell look of Melrose Abbey. One
morning Mr Laidlaw’s family were startled to see Sir
Walter approaching Kaeside, feeble, and wearing his
nightcap, which apparently he had forgotten to exchange
for a hat. No notice was taken of the circumstance.
After the usual kindly salutations, he said, with a
tremulous voice, that he had come to take a last look
of the abbey. He proceeded to an elevated point
commanding a view of the spot, and after gazing long
and anxiously down on the town and abbey, he said
slowly: ‘It is a venerable ruin!’ and returned to
Abbotsford.</p>

<p>The government, as is well known, placed a frigate
at his disposal for the voyage to the Mediterranean.
The reception at Portsmouth, and the arrangements on
board the <i>Barham</i>, were highly gratifying to Sir Walter
and his family. ‘The ship is magnificent,’ writes Mrs
Lockhart, ‘and carries four hundred and eighty men.
The rooms are excellent, and everything that could be
thought of for papa’s comfort, in every way, has been
done.’ Hopes of his ultimate recovery were entertained.
Cadell writes, December 29, 1831: ‘I have two long
letters from Sir Walter, one dated “Off Trafalgar, 14th
November,” and finished at Malta on the 23d. He is
in great glee, and must be much better. He has made
some progress with a new novel, <i>The Siege of Malta</i>.’
At the date of the second letter, he had got through
thirty of his own pages. Major Scott arrived from
Naples on the 1st of April 1832, and brought no very<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">183</span>
flattering tidings. ‘From his talk,’ writes Lockhart,
‘and from a huge bundle of letters which he conveyed,
we draw one inference—namely, that though the bodily
strength of your friend has improved since he left us,
there has been rather, if anything, a further dislocation
and prostration of the better part. Cadell is here, and
he and I and the major spent a sad enough evening
over the budget.’ All hope was soon dispelled. The
hurried journey home from Italy induced another attack
of apoplexy. He was struck while in the steamboat on
the Rhine at Cologne, and fell into Miss Scott’s arms.
Nicholson bled him instantly, and restored animation.
They pushed on for Rotterdam, and got there just as
the London boat was setting off for England. Laidlaw
writes to a friend:</p>

<p>‘You will see by the newspapers that Sir Walter is
coming home to die, I fear, or worse. It has come to
what I always feared since he told me that Mr Cadell
had half the proceeds of the great new edition. Sir
Walter’s permanent income is, as you know, reduced
salary, £840; sheriffdom, £300—total, £1140. No
person can live at Abbotsford, and keep it up, in a
country-gentlemanly way, under £2000 a year, for it
will take nearly £1200 for servants, taxes, coals, garden,
horses, &amp;c. The run of strangers was immense. Sir
Walter wrote for Keepsakes, Reviews, &amp;c., and kept
things going; but of late this stream dried up, and he
has been confused in his notions of money matters.
He is much involved, and will not be able to draw any
more than his salaries. He has all this winter taken it
into his head that his debts are paid off, and this was
from catching at an idea of Cadell’s of borrowing money
and paying the creditors all except the interest. He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">184</span>
will know the truth when he comes to London, and
this, with the winter and cold weather, will kill him.
How can a man with his sensibility, used for thirty years
to the strongest excitement, and living on popular
applause, in luxury, glitter, and show, survive when all
is gone, and nothing but ruin, coldness, and darkness
remain?’</p>

<p>Deprived of the use of his right arm and side, weak
and depressed, Sir Walter reached London on the
evening of the 13th of June 1832. Five days later,
Cadell writes: ‘Our poor friend is still alive, but very
ill. He took leave of his children to-day, very clearly
and distinctly. In the morning, he mistook Lockhart
for me; and it was some time before he could be put
right. The doctors doubt his getting over to-night.’
He rallied, however, and next month was conveyed to
Abbotsford. Laidlaw’s account of Sir Walter’s arrival
(written the day after) differs in some particulars from
the narrative of Lockhart—one of the most affecting
narratives in the language.</p>

<p>‘I was at the door when he’ [Sir Walter], ‘Mr and Mrs
Lockhart, and Miss Scott arrived. They said he would
not know me. He was in a sort of long carriage that
opened at the back. He had an uncommon stupid
look, staring straight before him; and assuredly he did
not know where he was. It was very dismal. I began
to feel myself agitated in spite of all my resolution.
Lockhart ordered away the ladies; and two servants, in
perfect silence, lifted him out, and carried him into the
dining-room. I followed, of course. They had placed
him in a low arm-chair, where he reclined. Mrs Lockhart
made a sign for me to step forward to see if he
would recognise me. She said: “Mr Laidlaw, papa.”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">185</span>
He raised his eyes a little, and when he caught mine,
he started, and exclaimed: “Good God, Mr Laidlaw!
I have thought of you a thousand times!” and he held
out his hand. They were all very much surprised; and
it being quite unexpected, I was much affected. He
was put to bed. I had gone into one of the empty
rooms, and some little time after Nicholson came to
tell me that Sir Walter wished to see me. He spoke a
little confusedly, but inquired if the people were suffering
any hardship, if they were satisfied, &amp;c. I had written
to him that I had paid off nine or ten of the men after
he had gone away last year. I did not remain long.</p>

<p>‘I understand Sir Walter’s mind has been wandering
from one dream to another; but now and then breaking
through the cloud that hangs over it, and surprising his
attendants with glimpses of his original intellect. Alas,
alas! However, he has rested better than for some
time past, and was wheeled into the library’ [July 12],
‘and seemed gratified. When I called about eleven
o’clock, he was sound asleep.’</p>

<p>A fortnight later, Laidlaw writes:</p>

<p>‘Sir Walter is generally collected in the morning, and
very restless and troublesome to his daughters during
the afternoon and night; often raving, but always quiet,
and generally shewing command of himself when Lockhart
comes in. Sometimes he seemed gratified at being
at home, and even once or twice made pertinent
quotations, and spoke of books, &amp;c. Until yesterday,
he always knew me, and I clearly saw he had then a
distressing desire to speak to me. I perceived that
although he might appear to feel little pain, he was
really suffering a great deal, partly from a sense of his
situation and inaction, but chiefly from the overpowering<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">186</span>
cloud and weight upon his great intellect. Yesterday,
he was apparently unconscious; he could not speak,
but was wheeled into the library for awhile. I never
witnessed a more moving or more melancholy sight.
Once, when Lockhart spoke of his restlessness, he
replied: “There will be rest in the grave.”’</p>

<p>One delusion under which the illustrious sufferer
laboured was preparing Abbotsford for the reception of
the Duke of Wellington. Another was, his personation
of the character of a Scottish judge trying his own
daughters. In the course of the latter, there were
painful bursts of violence and excitement. ‘It is
strange,’ said Laidlaw, ‘that he never refers to any of
his works or literary plans.’ The truth is, he had
thrown them off, to use an expression of his own, with
‘an effort as spontaneous as that of a tree resigning its
leaves to the wind,’ and they soon passed from his
memory. Besides, he had, when in health, always
practised a modest reticence respecting his works,
which had become habitual. The following points to
the end of the struggle:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>‘Poor papa still lingers, although in the most hopeless
state of mind and body. For this week past, the doctor
has taken leave every day, saying he could not survive
the twenty-four hours; and to-day, he says the pulse is
weaker and worse than ever it has been, and that his
living is almost a miracle. How thankful we shall be
when it pleases God he is at rest, for a more complete
aberration of mind never was before; and he even now
is so violent we sometimes dare not go within reach of
his hand. And the miserable scenes we have witnessed
before his strength was reduced as it now is! One<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">187</span>
great comfort has been, all suffering, so far as we can
judge, mental or bodily, has been spared, and that for
two months past he has not for an instant been aware of
his situation. My brothers were sent for, and have
been here for two days. When all is over, Anne and I
and the children will leave this now miserable place for
ever. Lockhart is obliged to go straight to London,
but we mean to spend a couple of weeks with his
relations in Lanarkshire, and perhaps take Rokeby in
our way up. We are both much better than you would
expect under such sad circumstances. Excuse this
miserable scrawl; I hardly know what I write....</p>

</div>

<p>On the day succeeding that on which this melancholy
letter would seem to have been written, Sir Walter had
a brief interval of consciousness, as described by Lockhart,
although the biographer would appear to have
misdated the arrival of the sons of the poet. A few
more days terminated the struggle; Sir Walter died on
the 21st of September. In October, Laidlaw notes
that Major Scott had given him, accompanied with a
most gratifying letter, the locket which Sir Walter constantly
wore about his neck. This was presented to Sir
Walter by Major Scott and his wife (inscribed ‘From
Walter and Jane’) on the day of their marriage, and it
contained some of the hair of each. Major Scott
enclosed as much of Sir Walter’s hair as would supply
the place of theirs, which he wished to be taken out of
the locket. ‘I shall try to find room for all,’ said Mr
Laidlaw; and he did find room, interlacing the various<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">188</span>
hairs, and wearing the invaluable jewel to his dying day.
‘What a change the loss of Abbotsford must be to the
Fergusons and you all!’ writes Mrs Lockhart, ‘the
gentle Sophia,’ as Miss Martineau describes the fair
sufferer. ‘It breaks my heart when I think of the
silence and desolation that now reign there. They
talk of a monument! God knows papa needs no
monument; he has left behind him that which won’t
pass away. But if the people of Melrose do anything,
I think a great cairn on one of the hills would be what
he would have chosen himself.’ Let the hills themselves
suffice!</p>

<p>After the death of his chief, Mr Laidlaw removed to
the county of Ross, and was successively factor on the
estates of Seaforth and Balnagown. His health failing,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">189</span>
he went to reside with his brother, Mr James Laidlaw,
sheep-farmer at Contin, also in Ross-shire, and there he
died May 18, 1845. His remains were interred in the
churchyard of Contin, a retired spot under the shade of
Tor Achilty, one of the loftiest and most picturesque of
the Ross-shire mountains, and amidst the most enchanting
Highland scenery. The lord of the manor, Sir
George S. Mackenzie of Coul, Bart., erected a tomb,
with a marble tablet, to his memory.</p>

<p>Mr Laidlaw cherished with religious care all his
memorials of Abbotsford, where, indeed, his heart may
be said to have remained till its last pulsation. The
desk in which the first manuscript of <i>Waverley</i> was
deposited stood in his room; the works inscribed and
presented by the author were carefully ranged on his
shelves; the letters he had received from him were
treasured up; the pens with which <i>Ivanhoe</i> was written
were laid past, and kept as a sacred thing; but above
all he valued the brooch which was round the neck of
Scott when he died. That most interesting ornament
Mr Laidlaw wore while a trace of sensibility remained,
and it has descended to another generation—one of the
most precious of the personal <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">reliquiæ</i> of a splendid but
melancholy friendship.</p>

<div class="tb">* * * * *</div>

<p>The biographer of Scott, John Gibson Lockhart, was
not a social or clubable man. He was fastidious and
reserved, silent in mixed company (he heard with only
one ear, and was too proud to acknowledge it), and was
inveterately prone to satire, so that he earned for himself
the appellation of ‘The Scorpion,’ and he was a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">190</span>
victim to dyspepsia, which, perhaps, like charity, ought
to cover a multitude of sins. His fine acute intellect
and classic taste were often obscured and his better
sympathies chilled by pain and languor. To a few
friends, however, Lockhart at times unbosomed himself.
With them his cold, sarcastic, haughty manner melted
away—at least for a season—and in those genial hours
he was the most confiding and delightful of companions.
As shewing the better nature and higher feelings of the
man, we are tempted to subjoin one of his letters to
William Laidlaw, in which he speaks of the sense of
duty and responsibility under which he wrote the
Memoirs of Scott—a work which, with all its faults, is
unquestionably the best biography since Boswell’s <i>Life
of Johnson</i>. There is great tenderness in the following
letter; and the picture which the writer draws of his
happy fireside contrasts painfully with his latter years,
when broken health, a desolate hearth, and feelings
lacerated by paternal troubles and anxieties, might have
made him join in that lamentation of the ancient
British bard which he applied to the old age of Thomas
Campbell:</p>

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="in0">Few letters of Lockhart’s are so generally interesting or
so valuable, biographically, as the following:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="right">
‘<span class="smcap">London</span>, <i>January 19, 1837</i>.
</p>

<p>‘<span class="smcap">My dear Laidlaw</span>—I received yesterday your letter
and a very munificent donation of ptarmigan, for both
which accept my best thanks. They were both welcome<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">191</span>
as remembrancers of Scotland, of old days, and of your
kindness and affection, of which last, though I am the
worst of correspondents, neither I nor my wife are ever
forgetful. The account you give of your situation at
present is, considering how the world wags, not unsatisfactory.
Would it were possible to find myself placed
in something of a similar locality, and with the means
of enjoying the country by day and my books at night,
without the necessity of dividing most of my time
between the labours of the desk—mere drudge-labours
mostly—and the harassing turmoil of worldly society,
for which I never had much, and now-a-days have
rarely indeed any, relish! But my wife and children
bind me to the bit, and I am well pleased with the
fetters. Walter is now a tall and very handsome boy of
near eleven years; Charlotte, a very winsome gipsy of
eight—both intelligent in the extreme, and both, notwithstanding
all possible spoiling, as simple, natural,
and unselfish as if they had been bred on a hillside
and in a family of twelve. Sophia is your old friend—fat,
fair, and by-and-by to be forty, which I now am,
and over, God bless the mark! but though I think I am
wiser, at least more sober, neither richer nor more
likely to be rich than I was in the days of Chiefswood
and Kaeside—after all, <em>our</em> best days, I still believe.</p>

<p>‘Politics, over which we used sometimes to dispute,
I have quite forsworn. I have satisfied myself that the
age of Toryism is by for ever; and the business of a
party which can in reason propose to itself nothing but
a defensive attitude, without hope either of plunder or
honour, seems to me to have few claims on those who,
when it was in power, never were permitted to share
any of the advantages it so lavishly bestowed on fools<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">192</span>
and knaves. So I am a very tranquil and indifferent
observer.</p>

<p>‘Perhaps, however, much of this equanimity as to
passing affairs has arisen from the call which has been
made on me to live in the past, bestowing for so many
months all the time I could command, and all the care
I have had really any heart in, upon the manuscript
remains of our dear friend. I am glad that Cadell and
the few others who have seen what I have done with
these are pleased, but I assure you none of them can
think more lightly of my own part in the matter than I
do myself. My sole object is to do him justice, or
rather to let him do himself justice, by so contriving it
that he shall be as far as possible, from first to last, his
own historiographer; and I have therefore willingly
expended the time that would have sufficed for writing
a dozen books on what will be no more than the compilation
of one. A stern sense of duty—that kind of
sense of it which is combined with the feeling of his
actual presence in a serene state of elevation above all
terrestrial and temporary views—will induce me to touch
the few darker points in his life and character as freely
as the others which were so predominant; and my chief
anxiety on the appearance of the book will be, not to
hear what is said by the world, but what is <em>thought</em> by
you and the few others who can really compare the
representation as a whole with the facts of the case.
I shall, therefore, desire Cadell to send you the volumes
as they are printed, though long before publication, in
the confidence that they will be kept sacred, while unpublished,
to yourself and your own household; and if
you can give me encouragement on seeing the first and
second, now I think nearly out of the printer’s hands,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">193</span>
it will be very serviceable to me in the completion of
the others. I have waived all my own notions as to
the manner of publication, &amp;c., in deference to the
bookseller,<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">15</a> who is still so largely our creditor, and, I
am grieved to add, will probably continue to be so for
many years to come.</p>

<p>‘Your letters of the closing period I wish you would
send to me; and of these I am sure some use, and
some good use, may be made, as of those addressed to
myself at the same time, which all, however melancholy
to compare with those of the better day, have traces of
the man. Out of these confused and painful scraps I
think I can contrive to put together a picture that will
be highly touching of a great mind shattered, but never
degraded, and always to the last noble, as his heart
continued pure and warm as long as it could beat.—Ever
affectionately yours,</p>

<p>We are tempted to add a short extract from another
letter of Lockhart’s, because it mentions a pleasing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">194</span>
incident in the life of the second Sir Walter Scott. He
writes, 25th May 1843, that Major Scott and his wife
enjoyed perfect health in India, and he adds: ‘He
(Sir W. S.) tells me that hearing a Highland battalion
was to pass about fifty miles off from his station
(Bangalore), he rode that distance one day, and back
the next, merely to hear the <em>skirl</em> of the pipes! No
doubt there would be a jolly mess for his reception
besides; but I could not but be pleased with the touch
of the “auld man.”’</p>

<p class="in0">In publishing the ballad, Hogg added the following

simple and pathetic picture of a poor Ettrick maiden’s
feelings in leaving a service where she had been happy,’
and he adds that it has ‘long been and must ever be a
favourite with all who understand the delicacies of the
Scottish dialect, and the manners of the district in which
the scene is laid.’ A no less flattering or discriminating
notice had been previously given by a critic in the
<i>Edinburgh Review</i>, who, in quoting <em>one</em> song from the
four volumes of Allan Cunningham’s <i>Songs of Scotland,
Ancient and Modern</i>, selected Laidlaw’s ‘simple ditty’
as a ‘fair example of the lowly pathetic’ which would
‘go to the heart of many a village-bred Scotchman in
remote regions and all conditions of society.’</p>

<p class="fn1"><a id="Footnote_2" href="#FNanchor_2" class="fnanchor">2</a> [For a number of years after the decease of Sir Walter, there
were many small floating anecdotes and memorabilia of his habits,
and the happy way in which he would make some pleasantry out of
very ordinary occurrences. Two or three instances occur to recollection.—One
day, when walking along Princes Street, Edinburgh,
my brother, who accompanied him, made the remark that he was
evidently well known, for many persons looked back at him on
passing. ‘Oh, ay, ay,’ replied Scott jocosely; ‘more know Tom
Fool than Tom Fool knows!’—The late Mr Thomas Tegg,
publisher, Cheapside, having, on the occasion of visiting Scotland,
ventured with a friend to call on Sir Walter at Abbotsford, was
somewhat doubtful of his reception, for he had published a small
book in doggerel verse, designed to bring Scott’s muse into ridicule.
He was speedily relieved of his apprehensions. ‘I am sorry to
say,’ said Tegg apologetically, ‘that I happen to be the publisher
of <i>Jokeby, a Burlesque on Rokeby</i>.’ ‘Glad to see you, Mr Tegg,’
replied Sir Walter; ‘the more jokes the better!’—Mrs John
Ballantyne, in her reminiscences of Scott, states that, besides his
story-telling manner, he had another quite distinct, in which he
was accustomed to utter any snatch of poetry, such as a verse of
a Border ballad, or a simple but touching popular rhyme. ‘I
can never forget,’ she says, ‘the awe-striking solemnity with which
he pronounced an elegiac stanza inscribed on a tombstone in
Melrose Abbey:</p>

<div class="poetry-container w15">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indentq">“Earth walketh on the earth</div>

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>—On the occasion of an excursion with a friend to Dumfriesshire
and Galloway, Scott’s money happened to run out; and he
borrowed from his companion a pound-note at Tinwald Manse, and
two pounds at the inn of Beattock Bridge. The payment of the
loan became the subject of a bit of pleasantry. Returning home,
he enclosed three pounds to his friend, with the following lines:</p>

his copy of the ballad from the charter-chest at Philiphaugh.

cause of his doubts as to the antiquity of <i>Auld Maitland</i> was that
it wanted a clear intelligible story and main plot, so that it could
not be retained in memory for a couple of months. If the Professor
(alas, now no more!) had chanced, in any of his angling
excursions on the Tweed, to have fallen in with a brother of the
rod, Mr Stirling, Depute Sheriff-clerk of Peebles (also now gone),
he would have found at least one gentleman who could repeat the
whole ballad without a break, though he had not read a line of it
for more than twenty years. Hogg states explicitly that when the
sheriff visited his cottage at Ettrick, his mother recited or chanted
the ballad; and in a poetical address to Scott congratulating him
on his elevation to the baronetcy, the Shepherd says:</p>

In the first edition he says: ‘From the remote period when the
Roman deity <span class="smcap">Terminus</span> retired behind the ramparts of <span class="smcap">Severus</span>,’
&amp;c. This seemed a little inflated, and also inappropriate, for it
represents Terminus as if capable of motion, though the Romans
represented the god as wanting legs and arms, to shew that he was
immovable; and Scott reduced the illustration to sober historical
limits: ‘From the remote period when the Roman province was

south end of Castle Street, backed by the rock; and put a cairn
on the Eildon Hill, that every lad might carry his stone to. As
for <em>temples</em> and <em>pillars</em>, they have been vulgarised in Edinburgh.
A friend said to me: ‘Good God, what a grand thing it will be
to have Sir Walter put on a level with the late Lord Melville!
Let us have another pillar at the west end of George Street, by all
means.’ This man is a sensible one, and was dead serious. On
a level with Lord Melville, whose name will appear only in the
fag-end of a note to the future history of this country, and really
will be kept in memory chiefly by the pillar! Dugald Stewart
and Playfair, admirable dominies both, have their temples; so I
fancy will now Sir John Leslie. The Calton Hill had better be
left to the schoolmasters; in a hundred years they will have covered
it; but, if they please, they may keep a place in the midst for Sir
John Sinclair.’—<cite>Letter to Hon. Mrs Stewart Mackenzie.</cite></p>

and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or

1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are

agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
